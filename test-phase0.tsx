/**
 * Phase 0 Test File - User-Friendly Tree View
 * 
 * This demonstrates the Phase 0 implementation with:
 * - Recent Notes tracking (localStorage only)
 * - Branch Tree View (using existing data)
 * - Full accessibility (ARIA attributes)
 * - Persisted UI state
 * 
 * To test:
 * 1. Replace the import in annotation-app.tsx:
 *    - FROM: import { NotesExplorer } from "./notes-explorer"
 *    - TO:   import { NotesExplorerEnhanced as NotesExplorer } from "./notes-explorer-enhanced"
 * 
 * 2. Or use the enhanced version directly with feature flag:
 *    <NotesExplorerEnhanced enableTreeView={true} ... />
 * 
 * Key Features (Phase 0 - Client Only):
 * - ✅ Recent Notes: Tracks last 10 accessed notes in localStorage
 * - ✅ Tree View: Builds hierarchy from existing branch parentId relationships
 * - ✅ Accessibility: Full ARIA attributes (role="tree", aria-expanded, etc.)
 * - ✅ Persistent State: Expanded nodes saved in localStorage
 * - ✅ No New APIs: Uses only existing adapter.listBranches() data
 * - ✅ Non-invasive: Original functionality preserved
 * - ✅ Feature Flag Ready: enableTreeView prop for easy toggle
 * 
 * localStorage Keys Used:
 * - 'recent-notes': Array of {id, lastAccessed} objects
 * - 'tree-expanded': Object mapping nodeId to boolean expanded state
 * - 'annotation-notes': Existing notes list (unchanged)
 * - 'note-data-{id}': Existing branch data (unchanged)
 * 
 * Visual Structure:
 * |-- Recent (last 5 shown)
 * |   |-- Note A (2h ago)
 * |   `-- Note B (1d ago)
 * |-- Branch Tree (for selected note)
 * |   |-- [main] AI in Healthcare Research
 * |   |   |-- [note] AI Integration Analysis
 * |   |   |-- [explore] Diagnostic Accuracy
 * |   |   |-- [promote] Ethical Framework
 * |   |   `-- [note] Economic Impact
 * `-- All Notes (existing list)
 * 
 * Testing Checklist:
 * [ ] Recent notes appear when notes are selected
 * [ ] Recent notes show relative time (2h ago, 1d ago)
 * [ ] Tree view shows branch hierarchy with correct parent-child relationships
 * [ ] Tree nodes can be expanded/collapsed
 * [ ] Expanded state persists across page refreshes
 * [ ] Screen readers can navigate the tree (test with VoiceOver/NVDA)
 * [ ] All existing functionality still works
 * [ ] No new network calls are made (check Network tab)
 * [ ] Feature can be toggled with enableTreeView prop
