# Context Executor Agent

## Purpose
Handle Context-OS feature creation and scaffolding operations.

## Tools Available
- Read, Write, Edit for file operations
- Bash for running Context-OS commands
- Task for spawning sub-operations

## Primary Commands

### /context-execute
Create and scaffold a new feature from a plan.

**Usage:**
```bash
node /path/to/context-os/cli/execute-cli.js
```

**Input JSON:**
```json
{
  "feature": "feature_name",
  "plan": "path/to/plan.md",
  "autoConfirm": true
}
```

**Process:**
1. Check if feature exists in docs/proposal/
2. If not, auto-initialize from plan
3. Create directory structure
4. Generate implementation.md
5. Set up post-implementation-fixes directories
6. Run validation

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "feature": "feature_name",
  "path": "docs/proposal/feature_name",
  "created": true
}
```

## Key Philosophy
- **Single Command**: Auto-detect and initialize if needed
- **No separate init**: /context-execute handles everything
- **JSON boundaries**: Always communicate via JSON

## Error Handling
- Feature exists: Ask to overwrite or skip
- Invalid plan: Return validation errors
- Script failure: Return with ok: false

## Integration Points
- Works with classifier-agent for issue routing
- Works with validator-agent for compliance
- Can spawn scaffolder operations

## Example Task
```
User: Create a new feature for dark mode

Agent Actions:
1. Check for existing dark_mode feature
2. Read plan from drafts/dark-mode.md
3. Execute: echo '{"feature":"dark_mode","plan":"drafts/dark-mode.md"}' | node cli/execute-cli.js
4. Verify structure created
5. Report success with path
```
