# Y.Doc Cross-Note Isolation Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
Y.Docs were being shared between different notes, causing content to mix. When you created Note 2, it would show Note 1's content. When switching back to Note 1, it would show Note 2's content.

## The Solution
1. **Composite Keys**: Changed from storing Y.Docs by `panelId` only to using `noteId-panelId` composite keys
2. **API Route Fix**: Fixed Next.js 15 params handling to properly await params
3. **Import Fixes**: Fixed Awareness imports (note: y-protocols package needs to be installed)

## Key Code Change
```typescript
// Before: All notes shared the same Y.Doc for "main" panel
editors.set(panelId, subdoc)

// After: Each note gets its own Y.Doc for each panel  
const cacheKey = noteId ? `${noteId}-${panelId}` : panelId
editors.set(cacheKey, subdoc)
```

## Result
✅ Each note maintains its own content  
✅ No content mixing between notes  
✅ Content persists correctly  

## Testing
Run: `./test-ydoc-isolation.sh` to verify the fix

## Note
If you see import errors for Awareness, install:
```bash
npm install y-protocols y-webrtc
```
