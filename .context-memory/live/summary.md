Recent Chat
- chat [2025-09-06 05:50Z] user: is the ff complete text are also stored right now?:What I changed

- Preferences: Set auto_chat_logging=true and auto_refresh_summary=true in .context-memory/live/state.json.
- Policy doc: Updated .context-memory/live/writer-policy.md with an Automation section.
- Journal: Logged your request and the policy change.
- Summary: Refreshed; Recent Chat now shows your message and this confirmation.

Result

- Future user/assistant messages are logged automatically to .context-memory/live/journal.ndjson.
- summary.md updates after notable events without asking.

If you later want to disable this, say “disable auto chat logging” or “disable auto refresh,” and I’ll flip the
flags and log it.

- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] assistant: Confirmed: auto chat logging and auto summary refresh enabled; I will persist future messages and updates without asking.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] user: can this be automatic so that you dont need to ask me again about saving thing like this in context-memory?
- chat [2025-09-06 05:47Z] assistant: Yes — chat logging is enabled and integrated into the summary. I updated scripts, recorded your question, and I’m now logging this reply so the pair appears together.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:46Z] user: is it possible to include the chat conversation in the context-memory?
