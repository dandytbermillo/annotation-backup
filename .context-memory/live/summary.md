- commit [2025-09-07 01:38Z] c82e5fe: adding context-os proposal doc
- note [2025-09-06 22:58Z]: Audited context-os/CLAUDE_NATIVE_AGENT_RESEARCH.md for readiness: command naming mismatches (/context-execute vs /execute), safety tiers (3-tier vs 4-tier), logging levels (5 vs 4), concurrency cap (5 vs 2), cache TTL not implemented, resource limits not enforced. Preparing correction list + patch preview on approval.
- note [2025-09-06 22:49Z]: Reviewed RESUME.md and CLAUDE_NATIVE_AGENT_PROPOSAL.md reference; preparing recap + adoption plan proposal.
- note [2025-09-07 13:45Z]: Policy update: Added Clarification & Approval Protocol — always ask on ambiguity, no edits to context-os/ without explicit approval, confirm scope, and log intent/results in journal.
- note [2025-09-07 13:40Z]: Output styling policy: Use underlined text for emphasis in CLI outputs; avoid background colors. Docs may use <u> tags sparingly. Preference recorded per user request.
- note [2025-09-06 14:06Z]: Added linkfiles/INDEX.md with descriptions and authoritative source paths.
- note [2025-09-06 14:05Z]: Copied referenced docs/scripts to live/guides/linkfiles (excluded live log/state files).

Recent Chat
- chat [2025-09-06 05:50Z] user: is the ff complete text are also stored right now?:What I changed

- Preferences: Set auto_chat_logging=true and auto_refresh_summary=true in .context-memory/live/state.json.
- Policy doc: Updated .context-memory/live/writer-policy.md with an Automation section.
- Journal: Logged your request and the policy change.
- Summary: Refreshed; Recent Chat now shows your message and this confirmation.

Result

- Future user/assistant messages are logged automatically to .context-memory/live/journal.ndjson.
- summary.md updates after notable events without asking.

If you later want to disable this, say “disable auto chat logging” or “disable auto refresh,” and I’ll flip the
flags and log it.

- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] assistant: Confirmed: auto chat logging and auto summary refresh enabled; I will persist future messages and updates without asking.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] user: can this be automatic so that you dont need to ask me again about saving thing like this in context-memory?
- chat [2025-09-06 05:47Z] assistant: Yes — chat logging is enabled and integrated into the summary. I updated scripts, recorded your question, and I’m now logging this reply so the pair appears together.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:46Z] user: is it possible to include the chat conversation in the context-memory?
