# Context-OS — Live Context Summary

Current Work
- Feature: initial_live_context
- Branch: (unset)
- Status: in_progress

Recent Activity (showing last 10 of 189)
- note: Let modifier clicks on collapsible headers bubble to selection plugin; plain clicks still enter title edit.
- note: Header modifier clicks now resolve block position via posAtCoords so range selection uses same positions as plugin.
- commit [2025-09-24 19:31Z] 8ec0a89: shift+click can now highlight the block
- note: Shift/cmd header clicks now run selection commands directly (select anchor + set range / toggle multi) using NodeView position lookup.
- note: Hooked shift/meta header mousedown to trigger selection commands and refocused editor so Shift+Click/Shift+Arrow flows engage plugin state.
- note: Ran .context-[REDACTED].js at user request.
- note: Intercepted header events in capture phase and stopped plain arrow clicks from hitting selection plugin to match research behavior.
- note: Added modifier-aware header mousedown guard so plain clicks stay in edit mode while Shift/Cmd propagate to selection.
- note: Updated collapsible block header handling so modifier clicks reach selection plugin; guarded arrow toggle.
- commit [2025-09-24 12:25Z] bddde5d: multi-select block implemented not tested

Result

- Future user/assistant messages are logged automatically to .context-memory/live/journal.ndjson.
- summary.md updates after notable events without asking.

If you later want to disable this, say “disable auto chat logging” or “disable auto refresh,” and I’ll flip the
flags and log it.

- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] user: can this be automatic so that you dont need to ask me again about saving thing like this in context-memory?
- chat [2025-09-06 05:47Z] assistant: Yes — chat logging is enabled and integrated into the summary. I updated scripts, recorded your question, and I’m now logging this reply so the pair appears together.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:46Z] user: is it possible to include the chat conversation in the context-memory?
