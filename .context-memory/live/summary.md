- commit [2025-09-26 01:40Z] 50ee4cb: refine the inline button in the block
- note: Added delayed hover timers for header controls so expand bubble and action tray only show after sustained hover; quick passes no longer flash buttons.
- note: Updated collapsible block header so hover shows only metadata plus expand control; added timed action tray reveal and new move commands remain accessible inside expanded controls.
- note: Test note for summary refresh check.
- note: Implemented multi-select move up/down commands and wired toolbar buttons to them; added NodeView sync effect for collapsed state earlier.
- note: Synced NodeView collapsed state with node attrs so multi-select collapse/expand updates reflect immediately.
- commit [2025-09-26 00:41Z] 14392df: delete worked
- note: Added multi-selection toolbar to interactive whitelist in collapsible-block node view so header capture no longer clears selection when pressing multi-select actions.
- note: Reviewed CollapsibleBlock multi-select toolbar logs; saw NODEVIEW_PLAIN_MOUSEDOWN_CLEAR firing when buttons clicked. Planning patch to mark multi-selection buttons as interactive targets so header capture stops clearing selection.

Recent Chat
- chat [2025-09-06 05:50Z] user: is the ff complete text are also stored right now?:What I changed

- Preferences: Set auto_chat_logging=true and auto_refresh_summary=true in .context-memory/live/state.json.
- Policy doc: Updated .context-memory/live/writer-policy.md with an Automation section.
- Journal: Logged your request and the policy change.
- Summary: Refreshed; Recent Chat now shows your message and this confirmation.

Result

- Future user/assistant messages are logged automatically to .context-memory/live/journal.ndjson.
- summary.md updates after notable events without asking.

If you later want to disable this, say “disable auto chat logging” or “disable auto refresh,” and I’ll flip the
flags and log it.

- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] assistant: Confirmed: auto chat logging and auto summary refresh enabled; I will persist future messages and updates without asking.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] user: can this be automatic so that you dont need to ask me again about saving thing like this in context-memory?
- chat [2025-09-06 05:47Z] assistant: Yes — chat logging is enabled and integrated into the summary. I updated scripts, recorded your question, and I’m now logging this reply so the pair appears together.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:46Z] user: is it possible to include the chat conversation in the context-memory?
