- note: Intercepted shift/meta header & arrow clicks in NodeView to call selection commands and log via debug API for multi-select diagnostics.
- note: Modifiers now bubble through click capture so plugin can run CMD_SET_RANGE.
- note: Plain header clicks no longer stop propagation; plugin now seeds selection. Modifiers still short-circuit title edit.
- note: Plain header clicks now bubble to plugin (no preventDefault); modifiers still short-circuit.
- note: Plain header clicks now invoke plugin selectCollapsibleBlock; modifier paths blocked in NodeView capture.

Result

- Future user/assistant messages are logged automatically to .context-memory/live/journal.ndjson.
- summary.md updates after notable events without asking.

If you later want to disable this, say “disable auto chat logging” or “disable auto refresh,” and I’ll flip the
flags and log it.
