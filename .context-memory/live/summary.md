- Preferences: Set auto_chat_logging=true and auto_refresh_summary=true in .context-memory/live/state.json.

Result

- Future user/assistant messages are logged automatically to .context-memory/live/journal.ndjson.
- summary.md updates after notable events without asking.

If you later want to disable this, say “disable auto chat logging” or “disable auto refresh,” and I’ll flip the
flags and log it.
