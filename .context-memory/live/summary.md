- commit [2025-09-25 19:39Z] 9fa8de9: fixing with response (GN)
- note: Modifier mousedown now preventDefault but keep bubbling so plugin handles range; no NodeView selection commands.
- note: Adjusted collapsible NodeView modifier handlers to pass through to selection plugin (no more duplicate commands).
- note: Added shift+click regression research plan (plan_v2) under docs/proposal/blocks_multiselect/click_arrow_with_shift.
- note: Intercepted shift/meta header & arrow clicks in NodeView to call selection commands and log via debug API for multi-select diagnostics.
- note: Modifiers now bubble through click capture so plugin can run CMD_SET_RANGE.

Recent Chat
- chat [2025-09-06 05:50Z] user: is the ff complete text are also stored right now?:What I changed

- Preferences: Set auto_chat_logging=true and auto_refresh_summary=true in .context-memory/live/state.json.
- Policy doc: Updated .context-memory/live/writer-policy.md with an Automation section.
- Journal: Logged your request and the policy change.
- Summary: Refreshed; Recent Chat now shows your message and this confirmation.

Result

- Future user/assistant messages are logged automatically to .context-memory/live/journal.ndjson.
- summary.md updates after notable events without asking.

If you later want to disable this, say “disable auto chat logging” or “disable auto refresh,” and I’ll flip the
flags and log it.

- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] assistant: Confirmed: auto chat logging and auto summary refresh enabled; I will persist future messages and updates without asking.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:48Z] user: can this be automatic so that you dont need to ask me again about saving thing like this in context-memory?
- chat [2025-09-06 05:47Z] assistant: Yes — chat logging is enabled and integrated into the summary. I updated scripts, recorded your question, and I’m now logging this reply so the pair appears together.
- chat [2025-09-06 05:46Z] user: is it possible to include the chat conversation in the context-memory?
