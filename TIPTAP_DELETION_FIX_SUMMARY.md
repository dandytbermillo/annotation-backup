# TipTap Content Deletion Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
The TipTap editor was deleting content when clicking on notes in the sidebar. This was caused by:
- Aggressive cleanup that destroyed editor Y.Docs when switching notes
- Empty Y.Docs being created and persisted, overwriting existing content

## The Solution
1. **Preserved Editor Docs**: Removed the code that destroyed editor Y.Docs in `destroyNote()`
2. **Empty Update Protection**: Added checks to prevent empty content from being persisted
3. **Smart Caching**: Editor content stays in memory for fast switching between notes

## Result
✅ Content is preserved when switching between notes
✅ No more data loss
✅ Faster note switching with cached content
✅ PostgreSQL only stores meaningful updates

## Testing
Run: `./test-tiptap-deletion-fix.sh` to verify the fix
