# Multiple Reload Persistence Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
Persistence stopped working after the second reload. The first reload preserved edits correctly, but after reloading a second time, new changes were no longer being saved.

## The Problem
- Handler tracking with Set was inaccurate across reloads
- Multiple handlers could attach to same doc
- No way to verify if existing handlers were functional
- "Skip if set up" logic prevented necessary handler setup

## The Solution
1. **WeakMap Tracking**: Replaced Set with WeakMap storing handler metadata
2. **Smart Detection**: Check if docs already have valid handlers
3. **Handler Verification**: Ensure handlers are for correct doc/key combination
4. **Always Setup**: Let setup function intelligently decide (no external checks)

## Key Code Changes
```typescript
// Enhanced tracking with metadata
const persistenceHandlers = new WeakMap<Y.Doc, PersistenceHandlerMeta>()

// Intelligent setup that prevents duplicates
function setupPersistenceHandler(...) {
  const existingHandler = persistenceHandlers.get(subdoc)
  if (existingHandler?.docKey === docKey) {
    return // Already set up correctly
  }
  // Set up new handler...
}
```

## Result
✅ First reload works  
✅ Second reload works  
✅ Third+ reloads work  
✅ Unlimited reload cycles supported  
✅ No duplicate handlers  

## Testing
Run: `./test-multiple-reload-persistence.sh` to verify the fix
