# Persistence Fix Verification

## Problem Summary
After page reload, new changes were not being saved to PostgreSQL. The initial content was preserved correctly on reload, but any subsequent edits were not persisted.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `lib/yjs-provider.ts` in the `getEditorYDoc` function:

1. When a Y.Doc was first created, it set up persistence handlers with a closure variable `initialLoadComplete = false`
2. After loading content from PostgreSQL, `initialLoadComplete` was set to `true`
3. When the same document was retrieved from cache later, it returned the cached doc WITHOUT re-establishing persistence handlers
4. The old update handler with its closure was still attached, but it might not work correctly in all cases

## Solution
Added a new function `setupPersistenceHandler` that:
1. Tracks which documents have persistence handlers using a Set (`docsWithPersistence`)
2. When retrieving a document from cache, checks if persistence is set up
3. If not, sets up the persistence handler fresh with new closure variables

## Code Changes

### Added tracking for documents with persistence:
```typescript
// Track which docs have persistence handlers set up
const docsWithPersistence = new Set<string>()
```

### Created a dedicated setup function:
```typescript
function setupPersistenceHandler(doc: Y.Doc, docKey: string, cacheKey: string): void {
  // Mark as having persistence to avoid duplicate handlers
  docsWithPersistence.add(cacheKey)
  
  // Fresh closure variables for each setup
  let initialLoadComplete = false
  let updateCount = 0
  
  // ... rest of persistence setup
}
```

### Updated all document retrieval paths:
1. When getting from cache - check and setup persistence if needed
2. When getting existing doc from enhanced provider - check and setup persistence if needed
3. When creating new doc - use the setup function

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Start the development server with PostgreSQL running
2. Create or open a note
3. Add some initial content to an editor panel
4. Reload the page (content should persist)
5. Add more content after reload
6. Reload again - ALL content should be preserved

The fix ensures that even when documents are retrieved from cache, they maintain proper persistence to PostgreSQL.

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Behavior**: All document retrieval paths now ensure persistence is properly set up
2. **No Duplicate Handlers**: Tracking prevents multiple update handlers being attached
3. **Fresh Closures**: Each persistence setup gets fresh closure variables, avoiding stale state
4. **Cache-Aware**: Works correctly with the document caching system
