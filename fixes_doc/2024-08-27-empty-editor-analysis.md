# Empty Editor Content Analysis
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Issue**: TipTap editor shows empty content when switching between notes
**Author**: Claude

## Problem Description
When users switch between notes, the TipTap editor displays empty content even though the content is properly stored in PostgreSQL. The previous fixes attempted to solve this but didn't address the root cause.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Asynchronous Content Loading Race Condition
The core issue is in `lib/yjs-provider.ts` in the `getEditorYDoc` function:

```typescript
// Line 171-184
// Load existing updates immediately when doc is created
if (enhancedProvider.persistence) {
  // Start loading immediately
  enhancedProvider.persistence.load(docKey).then((data: Uint8Array | null) => {
    if (data && data.length > 0) {
      // Apply the loaded state with 'persistence' origin to skip re-persisting
      Y.applyUpdate(subdoc, data, 'persistence')
      console.log(`Loaded content for panel ${panelId}, size: ${data.length} bytes`)
    }
    // Set flag after applying to ensure future updates are persisted
    initialLoadComplete = true
  }).catch((error: any) => {
    console.error(`Failed to load panel ${panelId}:`, error)
    initialLoadComplete = true
  })
}

return subdoc  // Returns immediately before content is loaded!
```

### 2. Component Rendering Timeline
Here's what happens when switching notes:

1. User clicks on a different note
2. `canvas-panel.tsx` calls `getEditorYDoc(panelId, currentNoteId)` (line 49)
3. `getEditorYDoc`:
   - Creates a new Y.Doc 
   - Starts loading content from PostgreSQL asynchronously
   - Returns the empty Y.Doc immediately
4. `canvas-panel.tsx` passes this empty Y.Doc to TipTap (line 577)
5. TipTap initializes with the empty Y.Doc
6. Content loads from PostgreSQL later, but TipTap doesn't re-render

### 3. Why Previous Fixes Failed
The previous fixes focused on:
- Caching Y.Docs to avoid recreation
- Preventing duplicate content
- Managing clear operations

But they didn't address the fundamental async loading issue. Even with caching, when switching to a note for the first time, the Y.Doc is created empty and returned before content loads.

### 4. TipTap's Y.js Integration
In `tiptap-editor.tsx`:
```typescript
// Line 108
const doc = ydoc || new Y.Doc()

// Line 133
Collaboration.configure({
  document: doc,  // Uses the empty doc
}),
```

TipTap's Collaboration extension binds to the Y.Doc at initialization. When content is loaded later via `Y.applyUpdate`, TipTap should theoretically update, but there seems to be a timing issue preventing proper re-rendering.

## Key Findings

1. **No Loading State**: There's no mechanism to wait for content to load before rendering TipTap
2. **No Re-render Trigger**: When Y.Doc content is loaded asynchronously, TipTap doesn't always detect the change
3. **Cache Key Mismatch**: The cache uses `${noteId}-${panelId}` but the doc key for persistence uses `${noteId || 'default'}-panel-${panelId}`

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Make Content Loading Synchronous (Not Recommended)
- Would block UI and create poor UX
- Goes against React best practices

### Option 2: Add Loading State (Recommended)
1. Track loading state in `canvas-panel.tsx`
2. Show loading indicator while content loads
3. Only render TipTap after content is loaded

### Option 3: Force TipTap Re-render
1. Add a mechanism to detect when Y.Doc content loads
2. Force TipTap to re-initialize or re-sync with the Y.Doc

### Option 4: Pre-load Content
1. Load all editor content when note is selected
2. Cache loaded content
3. Use loaded content when creating Y.Docs

## Implementation Plan
The next fix should:
1. Add a loading promise to `getEditorYDoc` that resolves when content is loaded
2. Make `canvas-panel.tsx` wait for this promise before rendering TipTap
3. Show a loading spinner during content load
4. Ensure proper error handling if load fails
