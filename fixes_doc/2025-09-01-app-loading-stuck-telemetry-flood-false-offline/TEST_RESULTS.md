# Test Results - App Loading Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-01
**Test Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

## Before Fix
- App stuck at "Loading application..." indefinitely
- Telemetry flooding every ~2 seconds
- False offline detection (`network: 'offline'`)
- Abnormal queue depth (1465)
- Terminal flooded with telemetry logs

## After Fix
- ✅ App loads successfully (`GET / 200`)
- ✅ Telemetry throttled to ~30 second intervals
- ✅ Network status correct (`network: 'good'`)
- ✅ Queue depth normalized (`queueDepth: 0`)
- ✅ Terminal logs clean and readable

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| App Load | Stuck | Success (< 1s) |
| Telemetry Interval | 2s | 30s |
| Network Status | offline | good |
| Queue Depth | 1465 | 0 |
| Event Batch Size | 50 | 500 (dev) |

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Test app loading
curl http://localhost:3001/  # Returns 200 with HTML

# Test health endpoint
curl -I http://localhost:3001/api/health  # Returns 200

# Check browser state (in console)
localStorage.getItem('offlineFeatureFlags')  # Should be null/undefined
```

## Cleanup Actions Taken

1. Removed stale feature flags from localStorage
2. Unregistered leftover Service Workers
3. Set correct environment mode (NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLAB_MODE=plain)

## Files Fixed

1. `components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx` - UnifiedProvider instead of CollaborationProvider
2. `components/offline/connectivity-badge.tsx` - Feature flag gating added
3. `lib/offline/telemetry.ts` - Dev mode throttling increased

## Result

The application is now fully functional with proper:
- Dynamic imports working correctly
- Network detection only when enabled
- Minimal telemetry noise in development
- Clean separation between Option A (plain) and Option B (Yjs) modes
