# Persistence Handler Closure Fix
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Issue**: Edits after first reload not persisting due to stale closures  
**Author**: Claude

## Problem Description
After the first reload, new edits were not being persisted. The initial content would load correctly, but any changes made after that first reload would be lost on subsequent reloads. The persistence worked only for the initial session.

## Root Cause
1. **Stale Closure Problem**: The `initialLoadComplete` flag was captured in a closure when the update handler was created. When reusing cached documents, the old closure values remained.
2. **Multiple Handlers**: New handlers were added without removing old ones, causing interference.
3. **Shared State Issues**: The load state wasn't properly shared between handler setups.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Object-Based State to Avoid Closures
**File**: `lib/yjs-provider.ts` (setupPersistenceHandler function)

Changed from:
```typescript
let initialLoadComplete = false
let updateCount = 0
```

To:
```typescript
const loadState = {
  initialLoadComplete: false,
  updateCount: 0
}
```

Using an object ensures the state is shared by reference, not captured by value.

### 2. Always Remove Existing Handlers
**File**: `lib/yjs-provider.ts` (setupPersistenceHandler function)

```typescript
// Always remove existing handler to ensure clean setup
if (existingHandler) {
  console.log(`[SETUP] Removing old handler for ${docKey}`)
  doc.off('update', existingHandler.handler)
  docsWithPersistenceHandlers.delete(doc)
}
```

### 3. Extensive Debug Logging
Added detailed logging with tags:
- `[SETUP]` - Handler setup events
- `[UPDATE]` - Persistence updates
- `[LOAD]` - Content loading
- `[CACHE]` - Cache retrieval

## How It Works Now
1. **Initial Session**: Handler set up with fresh state
2. **First Reload**: Doc retrieved from cache, old handler removed, new handler with fresh state
3. **After Load**: `loadState.initialLoadComplete` set to true
4. **New Edits**: Updates persist because `loadState.initialLoadComplete === true`
5. **Subsequent Reloads**: Process repeats, persistence continues working

## Testing
1. Create note with content
2. Check console: `[UPDATE] Persisted update 1 for note-X-panel-main`
3. Reload page
4. Check console: `[LOAD] Applied loaded content`
5. Make new edits
6. Check console: `[UPDATE] Persisted update 2` with `initialLoadComplete: true`
7. Reload again - all edits preserved

## Key Indicators
Success is indicated by:
- `initialLoadComplete: true` in update logs after reload
- Incrementing update numbers
- No duplicate handlers warnings

## Benefits
- Reliable persistence across unlimited reloads
- No stale closure issues
- Clean handler management
- Better debugging visibility
