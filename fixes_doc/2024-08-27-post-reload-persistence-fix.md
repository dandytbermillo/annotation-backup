# Post-Reload Persistence Fix
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Issue**: Changes not saving after reload (persistence handlers missing/stale)  
**Author**: Claude

## Problem Description
After reloading the app, the initial content was preserved correctly, but any new edits made after the reload were not being saved to PostgreSQL. The first reload worked, but subsequent changes were lost.

## Root Cause
When Y.Docs were retrieved from cache after reload:
1. They didn't have persistence handlers attached
2. Or had handlers with stale closure variables (`initialLoadComplete` stuck as `false`)
3. The enhanced provider's retrieval path also lacked persistence setup

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Persistence Tracking
**File**: `lib/yjs-provider.ts` (line 105)

```typescript
// Track which docs have persistence handlers set up
const docsWithPersistence = new Set<string>()
```

### 2. Created Centralized Setup Function
**File**: `lib/yjs-provider.ts` (lines 107-187)

```typescript
function setupPersistenceHandler(
  subdoc: Y.Doc, 
  docKey: string, 
  cacheKey: string,
  enhancedProvider: any
): void {
  // Skip if already set up
  if (docsWithPersistence.has(cacheKey)) {
    return
  }
  
  // Fresh closure variables for each setup
  let initialLoadComplete = false
  let updateCount = 0
  
  // Set up update handler with fresh variables
  subdoc.on('update', async (update: Uint8Array, origin: any) => {
    // Proper persistence logic with fresh state
  })
  
  // Track that this doc has persistence
  docsWithPersistence.add(cacheKey)
}
```

### 3. Updated All Retrieval Paths
**Cache retrieval** (lines 213-219):
```typescript
if (editorDocs.has(cacheKey)) {
  const cachedDoc = editorDocs.get(cacheKey)!
  // Ensure persistence is set up for cached docs
  const enhancedProvider = EnhancedCollaborationProvider.getInstance()
  if (enhancedProvider.persistence && !docsWithPersistence.has(cacheKey)) {
    setupPersistenceHandler(cachedDoc, docKey, cacheKey, enhancedProvider)
  }
  return cachedDoc
}
```

**Enhanced provider retrieval** (lines 295-301):
```typescript
const existingDoc = editors.get(cacheKey) as Y.Doc
// Ensure persistence for docs from enhanced provider
if (enhancedProvider.persistence && !docsWithPersistence.has(cacheKey)) {
  setupPersistenceHandler(existingDoc, docKey, cacheKey, enhancedProvider)
}
```

## How It Works Now
1. Every Y.Doc retrieval path checks if persistence is set up
2. If not, it sets up fresh handlers with new closure variables
3. The `docsWithPersistence` Set prevents duplicate handlers
4. All edits are properly persisted regardless of how the doc was retrieved

## Testing
1. Create a note with content
2. Reload the page - content preserved ✓
3. Make new edits after reload
4. Reload again - new edits should be preserved ✓
5. Continue editing - all changes persist ✓

## Benefits
- Consistent persistence across all retrieval paths
- Fresh closure variables prevent stale state
- No duplicate event handlers
- Works with cache, enhanced provider, and new docs
