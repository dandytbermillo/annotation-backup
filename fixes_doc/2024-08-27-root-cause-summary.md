# Root Cause Summary: Empty Editor Issue
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Issue**: TipTap shows empty content when switching notes
**Author**: Claude

## Critical Finding
The `lib/adapters/postgres-adapter.ts` file is EMPTY! This is the root cause of the persistence failure.

## Chain of Failures

1. **Missing Base Class Implementation**
   - `ServerPostgresAdapter` extends `PostgresAdapter` (line 7 of server-postgres-adapter.ts)
   - But `postgres-adapter.ts` is empty, providing no base implementation
   - This means `super.load()`, `super.persist()` etc. are calling non-existent methods

2. **Silent Failure Mode**
   - JavaScript/TypeScript doesn't throw errors for extending empty classes
   - The `super.load()` calls likely return `undefined` which is interpreted as no data
   - No errors are logged because the calls "succeed" but return nothing

3. **Why Content Never Loads**
   - When `getEditorYDoc` calls `persistence.load()`, it gets `undefined`
   - The promise resolves successfully but with no data
   - TipTap shows empty editor because no content was loaded

4. **Why It Works After Reload (Sometimes)**
   - The in-memory fallback (`MemoryAdapter`) might be caching some data
   - Or the browser's service worker/cache might be serving old data
   - But the PostgreSQL persistence is completely broken

## Verification
```bash
# Check if postgres-adapter.ts is empty
cat lib/adapters/postgres-adapter.ts
# Expected: Class implementation
# Actual: Empty file

# Check inheritance
grep -n "extends PostgresAdapter" lib/database/server-postgres-adapter.ts
# Line 7: export class ServerPostgresAdapter extends PostgresAdapter {
```

## Required Fix
We need to implement the `PostgresAdapter` base class with all the required methods:
- `persist(docName: string, update: Uint8Array): Promise<void>`
- `load(docName: string): Promise<Uint8Array | null>`
- `getAllUpdates(docName: string): Promise<Uint8Array[]>`
- `clearUpdates(docName: string): Promise<void>`
- `saveSnapshot(docName: string, snapshot: Uint8Array): Promise<void>`
- `loadSnapshot(docName: string): Promise<Uint8Array | null>`
- `compact(docName: string): Promise<void>`

This class should:
1. Use the PostgreSQL pool to execute queries
2. Handle the yjs_docs table schema
3. Properly encode/decode Uint8Array data
4. Handle errors appropriately

## Why Previous Fixes Failed
All previous fixes assumed the persistence layer was working and focused on:
- Caching strategies
- Race conditions
- Re-render triggers

But the fundamental issue is that NO DATA IS BEING PERSISTED OR LOADED from PostgreSQL because the adapter implementation is missing!
