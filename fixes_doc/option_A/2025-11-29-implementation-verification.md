## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 006)
- ✅ Added `parent_id` column to branches table
- ✅ Added `anchors` JSONB column
- ✅ Created index on parent_id
- ✅ Migration applied successfully

### 2. API Route Fixes
- ✅ Fixed parentId empty string to null conversion
- ✅ Fixed PATCH route params typing (Promise removal)
- ✅ Added soft-delete filtering (deleted_at IS NULL)
- ✅ All routes working correctly

### 3. Content Loading Fix
- ✅ Fixed race condition in TipTap editor initialization
- ✅ Added proper timing for content updates
- ✅ Enhanced provider logging for debugging
- ✅ Content now persists across note switches

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- __tests__/plain-mode/
```
- ✅ 10 TipTap fixes preservation tests pass
- ✅ Annotation workflow tests pass

### Integration Tests
```bash
./scripts/test-plain-mode.sh
```
- ✅ All 10 fixes work via API
- ✅ PostgreSQL stores JSONB (no binary)
- ✅ No Yjs artifacts in database
- ✅ Performance within thresholds

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Content saves to PostgreSQL
- ✅ Content loads when switching notes
- ✅ Content persists on page reload
- ✅ Annotation workflow creates proper branches
- ✅ Visual connections show with correct colors

## Current State

### What's Working
1. **Full annotation workflow** from text selection to new panel
2. **Content persistence** in PostgreSQL
3. **Content loading** when switching notes
4. **All UX features** from annotation_workflow.md
5. **Plain mode isolation** - no Yjs dependencies
6. **10 TipTap fixes** preserved and tested

### Known Issues (Fixed)
1. ~~Empty string parentId causing UUID insert failures~~ ✅ Fixed
2. ~~PATCH route params typing issue~~ ✅ Fixed
3. ~~Content not loading when switching notes~~ ✅ Fixed
4. ~~Soft-deleted branches showing in lists~~ ✅ Fixed

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify database schema
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d branches"

# Check for Yjs imports in plain mode
grep -r "from 'yjs'" lib/providers/plain-offline-provider.ts lib/adapters/*-offline-adapter.ts components/canvas/tiptap-editor-plain.tsx

# Run validation sequence
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm test -- __tests__/plain-mode/
./scripts/test-plain-mode.sh
```

## Conclusion

✅ **The implementation is complete and verified against all requirements.**

All features from `docs/annotation_workflow.md` are implemented, all compliance requirements from `PRPs/postgres-persistence.md` are met, and all critical fixes have been applied. The annotation workflow works end-to-end in plain mode without any Yjs dependencies.
