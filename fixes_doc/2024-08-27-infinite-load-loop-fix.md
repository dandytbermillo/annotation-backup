# Infinite Load Loop Fix
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Issue**: Continuous /api/persistence/load requests preventing proper persistence  
**Author**: Claude

## Problem Description
The terminal was flooding with continuous GET requests to `/api/persistence/load/` even when the user was idle. This infinite loop was preventing persistence from working properly after reload.

## Root Cause
1. **getEditorYDoc called on every render**: The component was calling `getEditorYDoc` without memoization
2. **setupPersistenceHandler called repeatedly**: Every call to `getEditorYDoc` triggered `setupPersistenceHandler`
3. **Multiple concurrent loads**: Each handler setup initiated a new load request
4. **No guard against duplicate handlers**: Handlers were being added without checking if already present

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Memoized Y.Doc Retrieval
**File**: `components/canvas/canvas-panel.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
const ydoc = getEditorYDoc(panelId, currentNoteId)
```

To:
```typescript
const ydoc = useMemo(() => getEditorYDoc(panelId, currentNoteId), [panelId, currentNoteId])
```

### 2. Prevent Concurrent Loads
**File**: `lib/yjs-provider.ts`

Added tracking:
```typescript
// Track which docs are currently loading
const docsCurrentlyLoading = new Set<string>()

// In setupPersistenceHandler:
if (docsCurrentlyLoading.has(cacheKey)) {
  console.log(`[SETUP] Already loading ${cacheKey}, skipping duplicate load`)
  return
}
docsCurrentlyLoading.add(cacheKey)
```

### 3. Guard Against Duplicate Handler Setup
**File**: `lib/yjs-provider.ts`

In `getEditorYDoc`:
```typescript
// Only set up if not already loading or set up
if (!docsCurrentlyLoading.has(cacheKey) && !docsWithPersistenceHandlers.has(existingDoc)) {
  setupPersistenceHandler(existingDoc, docKey, cacheKey)
}
```

## How It Works Now
1. Y.Doc is retrieved only when panelId or noteId changes (memoized)
2. Load requests are initiated only once per document
3. Handlers are set up only if not already present
4. No more infinite loops of load requests

## Testing
1. Open the app and watch the terminal
2. Click on a note - should see only ONE load request
3. Edit content - should see persist requests
4. Terminal should be quiet when idle
5. Reload - content should persist correctly

## Console Indicators
✅ Success:
```
[getEditorYDoc] Setting up persistence for cached doc note-123-panel-main
[LOAD] Loading data for note-123-panel-main
[UPDATE] Persisted update 1
```

❌ Fixed (no longer happens):
```
GET /api/persistence/load/note-123-panel-main 200 in 4ms
GET /api/persistence/load/note-123-panel-main 200 in 3ms
GET /api/persistence/load/note-123-panel-main 200 in 5ms
... (repeating infinitely)
```

## Benefits
- No more infinite load loops
- Proper persistence after reload
- Better performance (fewer requests)
- Cleaner terminal output
