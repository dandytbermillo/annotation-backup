# Persistence Closure Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
Edits made after the first reload were not persisting. The initial content would load, but new changes after reload were lost.

## The Problem  
- JavaScript closure captured the `initialLoadComplete` flag by value
- When reusing cached documents, the old closure kept `initialLoadComplete = false`
- This caused all updates after reload to be skipped

## The Solution
1. **Object-Based State**: Changed from variables to object properties
   ```typescript
   // Before: let initialLoadComplete = false
   // After:
   const loadState = {
     initialLoadComplete: false,
     updateCount: 0
   }
   ```

2. **Clean Handler Setup**: Always remove old handlers before adding new ones

3. **Debug Logging**: Added extensive console logging with [SETUP], [UPDATE], [LOAD] tags

## How to Verify It Works
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Create a note and add content
3. Look for: `[UPDATE] Persisted update 1`
4. Reload the page
5. Add more content
6. Look for: `[UPDATE] ... initialLoadComplete: true` ← This is the key!
7. Reload again - all content should persist

## Testing
Run: `./test-persistence-closure-fix.sh`

## Console Indicators
Success looks like:
```
[SETUP] Setting up persistence handler for note-123-panel-main
[UPDATE] Persisted update 1 for note-123-panel-main
[LOAD] Applied loaded content (237 bytes)
[UPDATE] Update handler called with initialLoadComplete: true ← Key indicator!
[UPDATE] Persisted update 2 for note-123-panel-main
```

## Install Missing Dependencies
If you see Awareness import errors, run:
```bash
./install-missing-deps-pnpm.sh
```

## Technical Details
- Modified: `lib/yjs-provider.ts` (object-based state, clean handler setup)
- Documentation: `fixes_doc/2024-08-27-persistence-handler-closure-fix.md`
