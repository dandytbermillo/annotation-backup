# Note Switching Fix Summary

## Issue
When switching between notes, the TipTap editor shows empty content even though content is saved and appears on reload.

## Root Cause
1. **Aggressive Cache Clearing**: The `clearEditorDocsForNote()` function was called when switching notes, removing all cached Y.Doc instances for that note
2. **Async Loading Race Condition**: When creating a new Y.Doc after clearing, content loads asynchronously from PostgreSQL while the editor renders immediately with an empty doc
3. **Lost Context**: The composite key system (`noteId-panelId`) already provides isolation between notes, making aggressive clearing unnecessary

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Aggressive Cache Clearing
- Commented out the `clearEditorDocsForNote()` call in `annotation-canvas-modern.tsx`
- The composite key system prevents content leakage between notes naturally

### 2. Added Smart Cache Management
- Implemented LRU-style cache with:
  - Maximum 50 editor docs in memory
  - 5-minute TTL for unused docs
  - Automatic cleanup when cache size exceeds limit
  - Last access time tracking

### 3. Improved Cache Key Handling
- Editor docs are now properly tracked with last access times
- Cache cleanup only removes old, unused docs
- Recently accessed docs are preserved for quick note switching

## Files Modified

### `/components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx`
```typescript
// Removed aggressive clearing:
// clearEditorDocsForNote(noteId)
```

### `/lib/yjs-provider.ts`
Added:
- `editorDocsLastAccess` Map to track access times
- `cleanupEditorDocsCache()` function for smart cleanup
- `MAX_EDITOR_DOCS` and `EDITOR_DOC_TTL` constants
- Updated `getEditorYDoc()` to track access times
- Modified `clearEditorDocsForNote()` to use aging instead of deletion

## Benefits
1. **Instant Content Display**: When switching back to a previously viewed note, content appears immediately
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Smart cache management prevents memory leaks
3. **Better Performance**: No need to reload content from PostgreSQL on every switch
4. **Preserved Editor State**: Y.Doc state is maintained across note switches

## Testing
1. Create multiple notes with content
2. Switch between notes rapidly
3. Content should appear immediately without flashing or empty states
4. Use `test-note-switching.js` script in browser console to verify

## Verification
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL for saved content
docker exec -it annotation_postgres psql -U annotation_user -d annotation_db -c "SELECT doc_name, LENGTH(updates) as size FROM yjs_updates WHERE doc_name LIKE '%-panel-%';"

# In browser console
console.log('Editor docs cached:', editorDocs.size);
```

## Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing a preloading mechanism for likely-to-be-accessed notes
2. Add metrics to track cache hit/miss rates
3. Make cache size and TTL configurable
4. Implement progressive loading for very large documents
