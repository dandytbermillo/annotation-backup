# Fix Summary: TipTap Editor Content Deletion on Note Switch

**Issue**: TipTap editor contents were being deleted when clicking on notes in the sidebar, even though data was persisting to PostgreSQL correctly.

## Root Cause

When switching between notes, the following sequence was occurring:

1. User clicks a different note in the sidebar
2. `annotation-app.tsx` updates `selectedNoteId` state
3. `ModernAnnotationCanvas` component re-renders with `key={selectedNoteId}`, causing unmount/mount
4. On unmount, `destroyNote(noteId)` was called, which:
   - Destroyed all editor Y.Docs for that note
   - Deleted cached content
5. On mount of new note, empty Y.Docs were created
6. Empty updates were being persisted to PostgreSQL, overwriting existing content

## Fix Applied

### 1. Prevent Editor Doc Destruction (`lib/yjs-provider.ts`)

Changed `destroyNote` method to preserve editor Y.Docs when switching notes:

```typescript
public destroyNote(noteId: string): void {
  // ... cleanup persistence and main doc ...
  
  // DO NOT destroy editor docs when switching notes
  // The composite key system (noteId-panelId) already isolates docs
  // This allows content to load immediately when switching back
  
  // Optional: Mark docs as older for cleanup priority
  editorDocs.forEach((doc, key) => {
    if (key.startsWith(`${noteId}-`)) {
      editorDocsLastAccess.set(key, now - (2 * 60 * 1000))
    }
  })
}
```

### 2. Remove Cleanup Call (`components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx`)

Removed the `destroyNote` call from component cleanup:

```typescript
return () => {
  // Don't destroy note when switching
  // The provider's smart cache management will handle memory efficiently
}
```

### 3. Filter Empty Updates (`lib/yjs-provider.ts`)

Added protection against persisting empty updates:

```typescript
// Skip very small updates that might be empty
if (update.length < 30) {
  const tempDoc = new Y.Doc()
  Y.applyUpdate(tempDoc, Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(subdoc))
  const prosemirror = tempDoc.getXmlFragment('prosemirror')
  const hasContent = prosemirror && prosemirror.toString().trim().length > 0
  
  if (!hasContent) {
    console.warn(`Skipping empty update for panel ${panelId}`)
    return
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Instant Content Display**: Cached Y.Docs show content immediately when switching back to a note
2. **Better Performance**: Fewer database queries and no unnecessary content reconstruction
3. **Smooth UX**: No empty editor flashes while waiting for content to load
4. **Memory Efficient**: Smart LRU cache eviction (max 50 docs, 5-minute TTL) prevents memory leaks

## How It Works Now

1. Editor Y.Docs are cached with composite key: `${noteId}-${panelId}`
2. When switching notes, docs remain in cache
3. Smart cache management evicts old unused docs when cache > 50 entries
4. Empty updates are filtered out to prevent content loss
5. Content appears instantly when switching between previously viewed notes

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Run the app and create content in a note
2. Switch to another note
3. Switch back - content should appear immediately
4. Check browser console for "Skipping empty update" messages
5. Monitor PostgreSQL for absence of small (< 20 byte) updates
