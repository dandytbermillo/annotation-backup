# Resume Here

> Open latest session summary: codex/previous-sessions/2025-09-01-session-summary.md

## Quick Status: Context‑OS (2025-09-05)
- Interactive INITIAL.md (Days 1–3): PASS with minor validator issues.
- Core components present: init-interactive CLI, Handlebars template + renderer, Claude mock adapter (invokeClaudeInit), session persistence (.tmp/initial), telemetry (logs/init-telemetry.jsonl).
- Known issues: validator expects Title as a section (template uses metadata); Acceptance Criteria key normalization bug in scripts/validate-initial-sections.js.
- Next steps: fix validator config/keys; optional aliases (--init-only/--resume-initial); run post-apply doc validator in init flow.

## Previous Session Summary
- Guide contradictions resolved: “ACTIVE RULES vs DEPRECATED” banner added to the Documentation Process Guide; verified after initial timing mismatch.
- Severity definitions: Agreed to adopt objective thresholds (10/25/50%) with environment multipliers; security remains Critical.
- Commands/aliases: Documented “Resume from readme.md”, “Start new session”, and “refresh resume”; defined resume output format (summary + last 3–4 messages).
- RESUME structure: Added Summary + Recent Messages sections to persist prior conversation context.

## Recent Messages (verbatim)
1) user: so you need to update the "refresh from resume.md" for the "resume from resume.md" to work well like this?
2) codex: Yes. To reliably show “summary + last 3–4 raw messages” when you say “Resume from RESUME.md”, the Refresh RESUME.md flow should persist those last messages. What to change… Want me to draft a small patch preview…?
3) user: yes
4) codex: Added a patch preview to document and support your desired behavior. What I added… Want me to apply this patch now and then update RESUME.md with the latest 3–4 messages?

- Operating Mode: Read-only advisory. Writes allowed only in `codex/` with explicit approval.
 - README Summary: fresh

- Latest summaries:
  - Executive: codex/previous-sessions/2025-09-01-exec-summary.md
  - Session: codex/previous-sessions/2025-09-01-session-summary.md

- Next steps:
 - If desired, approve implementing the above API and adapter hardening patches.
 - Keep the two blocks above current: update “Previous Session Summary” and “Recent Messages (verbatim)” during refresh/end-session
 - Decide on docs fix for contradictory rules (Item 2):
   - Minimal: apply `codex/patches/2025-09-02-doc-guide-lite-active-deprecated.patch` to add an "ACTIVE RULES vs DEPRECATED" banner (2-hour fix)
   - Or merged: apply `codex/patches/2025-09-02-item2-merged-proposal.patch` to add the comprehensive proposal doc
 - Consider applying `codex/patches/2025-09-02-refresh-readme.patch` to update the top-level README with TL;DR and links
 - Generate Phase 3 report/test scaffolding under `docs/proposal/unified_offline_foundation/` (as previews in `codex/` for review).
 - Use `codex/scripts/bench-api.sh` to baseline API timings pre/post changes.
 - Surface AGENTS.md in PRs (add PR template referencing AGENTS.md and codex/POLICY.md).
 - Note: `codex/POLICY.md` and `codex/previous-sessions/COMMANDS.md` updated with chat aliases (e.g., "Start new session", "Resume from readme.md")

  - Say “Refresh readme.md” to update README with today’s summary.

Updated by `codex/scripts/refresh-resume.sh`.
