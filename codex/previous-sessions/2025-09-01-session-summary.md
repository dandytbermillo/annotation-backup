# Session Summary — 2025-09-01

## Context
- User requested read-only advisory mode with explicit approval flow.
- Later restricted read/write operations strictly to `codex/` folder; writes permitted only upon explicit approval.
- Goal: Prepare Phase 3 implementation prompt and ensure alignment with the Unified Offline Foundation plan.

## Actions & Findings

### Repository Scan (read-only)
- Stack: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, TipTap; dual-mode architecture (Option A plain, Option B Yjs).
- Persistence API gaps identified (not applied):
  - Missing routes expected by `lib/adapters/web-postgres-adapter.ts`:
    - `GET /api/persistence/snapshot/:docName`
    - `GET /api/persistence/updates/:docName`
    - `DELETE /api/persistence/updates/:docName`
  - Type issue: `app/api/persistence/load/[docName]/route.ts` uses `params: Promise<...>`; should be a plain object.
  - DB upsert bug: `saveSnapshot` uses `ON CONFLICT (doc_name)` but `snapshots` table lacks a unique index on `doc_name`.
  - Fallback robustness: `ServerPostgresAdapter` only falls back at startup; runtime query failures should trigger in-memory fallback.
  - Optional consistency: default `COLLAB_MODE` could be `plain` to match README.
- Proposed (not applied) patches numbered 1–6 to address the above.

### codex/ Folder Review
- `codex/patches/` contains patch previews:
  - 0001 api-queue-flush parity; 0001b dual-mode (body ops vs DB drain with SKIP LOCKED);
  - 0002 import response consistency; 0003 search fuzzy threshold; 0004 canvas plain-mode fix;
  - 0005 connectivity badge flag gating; 0006 telemetry throttle.
- `codex/scripts/bench-api.sh`: curl-based timing harness for key APIs.
- `codex/templates/phase-implementation-prompt.md` and `phase2-implementation-prompt.md` present.

### Phase 3 Prompt Creation (approved writes to codex)
- Added `codex/templates/phase3-implementation-prompt.md` with Phase 3 — Conflict Resolution UI prompt.
- Adjustments made after verification:
  - Updated “Read:” paths to `docs/proposal/unified_offline_foundation/*`.
  - Verified alignment against `docs/proposal/unified_offline_foundation/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (user approved read outside `codex`).
  - Enhanced prompt with:
    - Explicit ticket dependencies for OFF-P3-* per plan.
    - “Scope (out)” section (advanced semantic merges deferred).
    - “APIs/Contracts” section (versions endpoints and 409 semantics).

## Approvals & Constraints Observed
- Operated read-only except for approved writes within `codex/`.
- Wrote and updated `codex/templates/phase3-implementation-prompt.md` with explicit user approval.
- Read access outside `codex/` (to `docs/proposal/unified_offline_foundation/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) was explicitly approved.

## Outstanding (Not Applied) Recommendations
- Add missing persistence API routes to match `WebPostgresAdapter`:
  - `app/api/persistence/snapshot/[docName]/route.ts`
  - `app/api/persistence/updates/[docName]/route.ts` (GET, DELETE)
- Fix load route params typing (`app/api/persistence/load/[docName]/route.ts`).
- Add DB migration for `snapshots(doc_name)` unique index to support upsert.
- Harden `lib/database/server-postgres-adapter.ts` to switch to memory fallback on runtime errors.
- Optional: default collaboration mode to `plain` for doc parity.

## Next Suggested Steps
- If desired, approve implementing the above API and adapter hardening patches.
- Generate Phase 3 report/test scaffolding under `docs/proposal/unified_offline_foundation/` (as previews in `codex/` for review).
- Use `codex/scripts/bench-api.sh` to baseline API timings pre/post changes.
