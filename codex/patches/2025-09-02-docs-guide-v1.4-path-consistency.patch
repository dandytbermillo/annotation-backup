 ## Simplified Structure for Minor Fixes

-For features with both major and minor fixes, prefer a shallow structure:
 +For low-severity fixes, keep documentation concise but in the canonical location:
 
 ```
 docs/proposal/<feature_slug>/
-├── reports/
-│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD-implementation.md  # main
-│   └── fixes/
-│       ├── critical/                 # full artifacts for major issues
-│       └── minor/                    # short markdown notes; inline artifacts allowed
+├── post-implementation-fixes/
+│   ├── critical/                     # full artifacts for major issues
+│   ├── high/
+│   ├── medium/
+│   └── low/                          # short notes allowed; inline artifacts OK
 ```
 
-This reduces nesting for small corrections while preserving depth where it matters.
+This keeps a single, consistent structure while allowing brevity for low-severity items.
