Subject: docs(guide): minimal Active vs Deprecated split to resolve contradictions now
Date: 2025-09-02

This minimal patch makes the guide immediately usable by adding an "ACTIVE RULES"
banner with the current v1.4 rules and a small "DEPRECATED (Do Not Use)" note,
then treating the rest of the file as historical reference. It avoids Rule IDs,
YAML headers, and heavy CI — focusing solely on removing contradictions fast.

 # Documentation Process Guide for Feature Implementation and Bug Fixes
 
 **Version**: 1.4.0  
 **Last Updated**: 2025-09-02  
 **Changes**: 
@@
 **Purpose**: Standardize documentation practices for all feature implementations and bug fixes
 
+## ACTIVE RULES (Authoritative — follow these only)
+
+These are the only rules to use today. Ignore any conflicting guidance below; it is historical.
+
+1) Directory Structure
+- Feature dirs use: `reports/` (single main Implementation-Report), `implementation-details/`, and `post-implementation-fixes/` with `README.md` index and severity subfolders.
+- Do not use `reports/.../fixes/`.
+
+2) Main Implementation Report (TOC/dashboard)
+- Links-only; no inline code/commands/diffs; 2–3 sentence Executive Summary.
+- Include: Scope of Implementation, Key Metrics table, Code Changes (counts + links), Acceptance Criteria (checkmarks only).
+- Include explicit `---` phase boundary; add "Post-Implementation Fixes" section with links only.
+
+3) Post-Implementation Fixes
+- All fixes AFTER Status: COMPLETE go under `post-implementation-fixes/<severity>/` with full details there.
+- Main report contains links to fixes only; no severity counts in the main report.
+
+4) Inline Content and Artifacts
+- Main implementation report: no inline commands/diffs/logs.
+- Fix reports: short inline snippets OK; long outputs go to `.../artifacts/`.
+
+---
+
+## DEPRECATED (Do Not Use)
+
+- "Inline artifacts for <10 LOC" in the main implementation report (legacy v1.1 guidance).
+- Any `reports/.../fixes/` paths — use `post-implementation-fixes/<severity>/`.
+
+---
+
+Note: The sections below are historical/background and may include examples that do not conform to Active Rules.
