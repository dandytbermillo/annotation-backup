Subject: docs(sessions): capture Summary + Recent Messages in RESUME.md
Date: 2025-09-02

This patch updates RESUME.md to store a Summary block and a Recent Messages
block (3–4 verbatim entries) and clarifies COMMANDS.md for Refresh/End session.

Proposed edits

1) codex/previous-sessions/RESUME.md (insert at top after title)

```
# Resume Here

## Previous Session Summary
- [Fill: 3–6 bullets covering purpose, key decisions, approvals, and next steps]

## Recent Messages (verbatim)
1) [Paste last message here]
2) [Paste previous message here]
3) [Paste previous message here]
4) [Optional]

- Operating Mode: Read-only advisory. Writes allowed only in `codex/` with explicit approval.
- README Summary: fresh
```

Also, under “Next steps”, add:

```
- Keep the two blocks above current: update “Previous Session Summary” and “Recent Messages (verbatim)” during refresh/end-session
```

2) codex/previous-sessions/COMMANDS.md (clarify Refresh/End behavior)

Change Refresh pointers section to:

```
- “Refresh RESUME.md” / “Refresh RESUME” / “refresh resume”
- I read current files and propose a patch updating `RESUME.md`:
  - Update “Previous Session Summary” (3–6 bullets)
  - Update “Recent Messages (verbatim)” with the last 3–4 messages (unsummarized)
  - Update “Next steps” and append recent patches
- You say “Approved” to save.
```

Change End session line to:

```
- “End session” → I propose the closing checklist: Refresh RESUME (Summary + Recent Messages), Refresh README, and summarize changes. You say “Approved” to save; I then mark “README Summary: fresh” in RESUME.md.
```

Notes
- This patch only updates docs; it does not auto-extract messages. During Refresh, paste the last 3–4 messages when prompted, or confirm I should use chat context if available.
