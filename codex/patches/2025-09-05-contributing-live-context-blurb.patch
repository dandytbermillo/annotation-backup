## Live Context in Pull Requests

- CI posts a single, auto-updated PR comment with the marker `<!-- live-context-comment -->` that summarizes the current repository context using `.context-memory/live/summary.md`.
- On each push to the PR, CI finds the existing comment (by marker) and updates it instead of posting a new one. This avoids comment spam.
- If PR comment permissions are limited (e.g., forked PRs), CI gracefully falls back to adding the same content to the GitHub Actions job summary only.
- CI is strictly read-only with respect to `.context-memory/`: it only reads `summary.md` and never writes to the live store. A guard step enforces this policy.

### Local Workflow (optional)

- Generate/refresh the summary locally at any time:
  - `node .context-memory/scripts/summarize.js`
  - Preview the PR snippet: `node .context-memory/scripts/generate-pr-summary.js`
- Auto-log commits and refresh summary locally by installing a post-commit hook:
  - `bash .context-memory/scripts/install-post-commit-hook.sh`

## Ignoring `.context-memory/live/`

- The files under `.context-memory/live/` (e.g., `journal.ndjson`, `summary.md`, `state.json`) change frequently and are treated like logs/cache during development.
- To keep diffs and `git status` clean, the repositoryâ€™s `.gitignore` ignores `*.context-memory/live/*` while keeping the folder tracked via `.context-memory/live/.keep`.
- If you need to share a snapshot, paste content into the PR or attach the generated `pr-summary.md` artifact rather than committing live files.
