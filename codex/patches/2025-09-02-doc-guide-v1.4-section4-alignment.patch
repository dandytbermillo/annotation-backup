Subject: docs: align DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS_GUIDE.md with v1.4 Section 4 (TOC main report, fixes location)
Date: 2025-09-02

This patch makes the documentation guide fully consistent with Improvement #4
(Implementation Report Content Structure) by:
- Keeping main reports as dashboards (links-only after COMPLETE)
- Moving all fix reports under post-implementation-fixes/<severity>/
- Adding a "Scope of Implementation" section to the main report template
- Fixing remaining path and example inconsistencies

 ### Legacy Paths Clarification
-- Always place new implementation and fix reports under reports/.
+- Always place new implementation reports under reports/. Place all post-implementation fixes under post-implementation-fixes/.

 ### Main Report Identification
 - Each feature MUST have exactly ONE main implementation report
-- Additional reports for fixes/updates go in subdirectories or use clear suffixes
+- Additional fix reports go under post-implementation-fixes/; the main implementation report remains the single source of overall status
 - The main report tracks overall implementation status and links to sub-reports
