# Context‚ÄëOS Summary and v1.1 Alignment

Source: codex/temp/CONTEXT_OS_DOCUMENTATION_v1.1.md and code under context-os/
Date: 2025-09-04

## Overview

Context‚ÄëOS is a documentation‚Äëfirst orchestration system that enables feature workflows via slash commands and CLI wrappers, with a safety‚Äëfocused hybrid bridge to optional Claude agents. It scaffolds compliant feature structures, manages post-implementation fixes, validates documentation rules, and tracks status.

## Structure Map (Repository)

- Command routing: context-os/command-router.js (routes `/execute`, `/fix`, `/validate`, `/status`, `/analyze`, `/help` through the bridge)
- Bridge layer: context-os/bridge/bridge-enhanced.js (+ claude-adapter.js, contextos-adapter.js, command-routing.js, budget-reporter.js, telemetry)
- CLI wrappers: context-os/cli/execute-cli.js, fix-cli.js, validate-cli.js (JSON-friendly, non‚Äëinteractive by default)
- Feature creation: context-os/create-feature.js (interactive orchestrator: slug, plan validation, scaffolding, patch preview, validation)
- Fix workflow: context-os/fix-workflow.js (classification, severity routing, index updates)
- Status: context-os/status-enforcer.js (blocks COMPLETE, lock/reopen tools)
- Agents (TS/JS): context-os/agents/* (orchestrator, plan filler, verifier, classifier)
- Core (TS): context-os/core/* (scaffolder, validator, types)
- Validation script: scripts/validate-doc-structure.sh (Guide v1.4.5 rules)
- Slash docs: context-os/SLASH_COMMANDS.md; BRIDGE.md; CLAUDE_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md

## Commands and Behaviors

- `/execute "<feature>" [--plan <path>] [--slug <slug>]`
  - Creates docs/proposal/<slug>/ with reports/, implementation-details/, post-implementation-fixes/{critical,high,medium,low}, patches/
  - Writes implementation.md from draft or minimal plan; generates main Implementation‚ÄëReport stub; optional review patch
  - Runs structure validation; prints next steps
- `/fix --feature <slug> --issue "desc" [--severity|--perf|--users|--env|--dry-run]`
  - Classifies severity/type; routes to severity dir; creates fix doc; updates post-implementation-fixes/README.md
  - Bridge defaults to dry‚Äërun for safety; patch‚Äëfirst philosophy
- `/validate [feature] [--strict|--all]`
  - Runs scripts/validate-doc-structure.sh; returns structured JSON via CLI wrapper
- `/status [feature]`
  - Lists feature statuses or prints one; integrates with status enforcer
- `/analyze <feature>`
  - Claude‚Äëonly analysis via bridge (mock adapter enabled)

## Bridge Highlights (bridge-enhanced.js)

- Enforces dry‚Äërun for write ops unless `--apply`
- Budgets for Claude calls (tokens, tools, parallelism, timeout, retries)
- Hybrid combination: deterministic artifacts from Context‚ÄëOS + Claude findings
- Patch generation for write ops; JSONL telemetry to context-os/telemetry (or configured path)
- Graceful degradation: fallback to Context‚Äëonly if Claude fails

## Validation Rules (Validator v2 Script)

- Required dirs: reports/, implementation-details/, post-implementation-fixes/
- Mandatory: post-implementation-fixes/README.md (Rule 1)
- Main report detection in reports/: presence, uniqueness warning, phase boundary `---`, link to fixes index (Rule 2)
- Discourages inline artifacts (fenced code blocks warning) (Rule 4)
- Status format check (üöß IN PROGRESS|‚úÖ COMPLETE|‚ùå BLOCKED) (Rule 7)
- Severity folder presence; severity consistency in fix files
- Patches/: README.md expected; patch names `YYYY-MM-DD-*.patch` (Rule 8 if adopted)
- Deprecated patterns flagged (e.g., reports/fixes/); legacy `fixing_doc/` warned

## Alignment vs Documentation v1.1

- Command coverage matches the doc intents; repo uses `/execute` et al (doc shows `/context-*` forms). Behavior aligns.
- Hybrid bridge and safety posture (dry‚Äërun, telemetry, patch‚Äëfirst) implemented and more detailed than spec.
- Scripts location differs: repo places validation under top‚Äëlevel `scripts/` instead of `context-os/scripts/` in doc.
- Slash documentation consolidated into SLASH_COMMANDS.md rather than per‚Äëcommand markdowns.

## Notable Gaps / Differences

- Patch naming conventions:
  - create-feature.js emits `draft-<ISO>.patch` inside feature `patches/` (non‚Äëcompliant with `YYYY-MM-DD-*.patch`).
  - Bridge emits `patches/bridge-<timestamp>.patch` at repo root (also non‚Äëcompliant, and outside feature scope).
- Doc paths: Documentation shows additional subfolders (`utils/`, `scripts/`, `slash_commands/`) under context-os/ that are represented differently in this repo.

## How To Run (NPM)

- Create feature: `npm run context:execute` (stdin JSON or interactive)
- Create fix: `npm run context:fix` (stdin JSON; `dryRun` true by default at bridge level unless `--apply`)
- Validate: `npm run context:validate` (stdin JSON; `strict` supported)
- Status: `npm run context:status -- list` or `-- check ../docs/proposal/<slug>`
- Direct validator: `bash scripts/validate-doc-structure.sh [--strict]`

## Recommendations

1) Align patch names to validator convention in both locations:
   - Feature patches: `docs/proposal/<slug>/patches/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-topic>.patch`
   - Bridge patches: prefer feature‚Äëscoped paths or include feature slug in name; match date prefix convention.
2) Update SLASH_COMMANDS.md to reflect actual script locations (root scripts/) and current command set.
3) Add `context-os/telemetry/README.md` to document JSONL format and retention/debug tips.
4) Consider adding per‚Äëcommand docs if desired by v1.1 (optional), or update v1.1 to reflect consolidated docs.

## Quick Next Steps

- Decide on patch naming/location policy and implement in create-feature.js + bridge-enhanced.js
- Run `npm run context:validate` across features and capture baseline
- If desired, harmonize docs to repo reality (scripts path, consolidated docs)
