# Documentation Process Guide v1.4.0 Improvements Plan

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Current Version**: v1.3.0  
**Target Version**: v1.4.0  
**Status**: 📝 PLANNED  
**Purpose**: Address all identified issues to improve LLM safety, clarity, and consistency

## Executive Summary

The Documentation Process Guide has evolved through v1.1, v1.2, and v1.3, accumulating contradictions and ambiguities that confuse LLMs and humans alike. This plan consolidates all necessary improvements to achieve a stable, clear, and safe v1.4.0 guide.

**Current Stability**: 6/10  
**Target Stability**: 9/10

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Standard Feature Directory Structure ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Unclear boundary between implementation and post-implementation phases.

**Solution**:
```
feature_name/
├── Implementation-Plan.md           # The plan (or INITIAL.md)
├── reports/
│   └── Implementation-Report.md    # High-level summary with Status marker
├── implementation-details/         # Initial implementation documentation
│   ├── [technical-docs].md
│   └── artifacts/
├── post-implementation-fixes/      # Issues found AFTER Status: COMPLETE
│   ├── README.md                  # Index of all fixes (MANDATORY)
│   ├── critical/
│   ├── high/
│   ├── medium/
│   └── low/
└── patches/                        # Optional code patches
```

**Key Rule**: Once Status: COMPLETE in Implementation-Report.md, ALL subsequent changes go to post-implementation-fixes/




### 2. Contradictory Version Rules - Single Source of Truth (SIMPLIFIED APPROACH)✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Multiple versions (v1.1, v1.2, v1.3) have contradicting rules mixed together.

**Specific Contradictions Found**:
- Line 127: "inline artifacts for small (<10 LOC) changes" (v1.1 rule)
- Line 138: "no inline fixes regardless of severity" (v1.4 rule)
- Line 322: "embed evidence directly when under ~10 LOC" (contradicts line 138)
- Result: LLM cannot follow both rules simultaneously!

**Solution**: Minimal "Active Rules + Deprecated" structure (2-hour fix):

```markdown
# DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS_GUIDE.md v1.4.0

## ACTIVE RULES (Authoritative — follow these only)

These are the only rules to use today. Ignore any conflicting guidance below.

1) Directory Structure
- Feature dirs use: reports/, implementation-details/, post-implementation-fixes/
- Do not use reports/.../fixes/

2) Main Implementation Report (TOC/dashboard)
- Links-only; no inline code/commands/diffs
- 2–3 sentence Executive Summary
- Include --- phase boundary
- Post-Implementation Fixes section with links only

3) Post-Implementation Fixes
- All fixes AFTER Status: COMPLETE go to post-implementation-fixes/<severity>/
- Main report contains links only

4) Inline Content
- Main report: NO inline commands/diffs/logs
- Fix reports: Short snippets OK

---

## DEPRECATED (Do Not Use)

❌ "Inline artifacts for <10 LOC" in main report (v1.1 guidance)
❌ Any reports/.../fixes/ paths
❌ Expert Review inline sections

---

Note: Sections below are historical and may not conform to Active Rules.
```

**Implementation Approach**: 
- **Complexity**: Minimal (no Rule IDs, no YAML, no complex CI)
- **Timeline**: 2 hours (not 4 weeks)
- **Impact**: Immediately resolves contradictions
- **Patch Available**: `codex/patches/2025-09-02-doc-guide-lite-active-deprecated.patch`

### 3. Clear Severity Definitions  ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Vague severity classifications causing inconsistent categorization:
- "perf regression" - could mean 1% or 90%
- "memory leak" - no timeline or threshold
- No environment consideration (Dev vs Production)
- Inconsistent classification between team members

**Solution**: Precise, measurable criteria with environment multipliers:

```markdown
## Severity Definitions with Objective Criteria

### 🔴 Critical (Immediate Action Required)
- Data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access (any amount)
- Security vulnerabilities (any exploitable, regardless of environment)
- Complete feature/system failure in PRODUCTION
- Compliance violations (legal/regulatory)
- Performance: >50% degradation in p95 latency (1-hour window, PRODUCTION)
- CPU/Memory: >50% increase (sustained 1-hour, PRODUCTION)
- Throughput: Reduced by >50% (PRODUCTION)

### 🟠 High (Urgent - Within 24 Hours)
- Memory leaks: >25% growth per 24 hours
- Reproducible OOM within 48 hours
- Core features broken (workaround exists)
- Performance: 25-50% degradation in p95 latency (PRODUCTION)
- User Impact: >10% of active users affected (measured per hour)
- API requests: >10% failing (per hour)

### 🟡 Medium (Important - Within 1 Week)
- Performance: 10-25% degradation in p95 latency
- Resource usage: 10-25% increase
- UX workflow disrupted (alternatives exist)
- Non-critical features broken
- User Impact: 1-10% of users affected

### 🟢 Low (Nice to Fix - As Time Permits)
- Performance: <10% degradation in any metric
- Cosmetic issues, typos, formatting
- Code quality, refactoring, tech debt
- Development-only issues (unless security)
- Documentation: Outdated comments, missing JSDoc

## Environment Multiplier
| Environment | Adjustment | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Production | Use as-is | High stays High |
| Staging | -1 level | Critical → High |
| Development | -2 levels | Critical → Medium |
| Local | -2 levels | Critical → Medium |
**EXCEPTION**: Security issues ALWAYS Critical

## Measurement Windows
- Performance metrics: 1-hour p95 (unless specified)
- Memory growth: 24-hour period
- User impact: Per-hour for urgent, per-day for trends
- Availability: 5-minute intervals for uptime

## Classification Examples
| Issue | Environment | Metrics | Base | Final |
|-------|-------------|---------|------|-------|
| 147% CPU spike | Dev | >50% CPU | Critical | Medium (dev -2) |
| API latency +35% | Prod | p95 +35% | High | High |
| Memory leak | Prod | +30%/24h | High | High |
| SQL injection | Dev | Security | Critical | Critical (exception) |
```

**Implementation Requirements**:

1. **Update Documentation Process Guide** - Add to ACTIVE RULES:
   ```markdown
   5) Severity Classification
   - Use objective criteria with measurable thresholds
   - Apply environment multiplier (Production/Staging/Dev)
   - Security issues always Critical
   - Document specific metrics in fix reports
   ```

2. **Update Bug Fix Template** - Add severity checklist:
   ```markdown
   ## Severity Classification
   - [ ] Performance impact measured: _____% (metric: _____, window: _____)
   - [ ] Environment identified: [Production | Staging | Development]
   - [ ] Environment multiplier applied: [Yes | No | N/A-Security]
   - [ ] User impact quantified: _____% over _____ period
   **Final Severity**: [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
   **Justification**: [1-2 sentences with specific metrics]
   ```

3. **Create/Update post-implementation-fixes/README.md** - MANDATORY index with severity organization:
   ```markdown
   # Post-Implementation Fixes Index
   **Severity Breakdown**: 🔴 Critical: 0 | 🟠 High: 1 | 🟡 Medium: 2 | 🟢 Low: 1
   
   ## 🔴 Critical Issues (Immediate Action)
   | Date | Issue | Environment | Metrics | Status | Link |
   
   ## 🟠 High Priority (Within 24 Hours)
   | Date | Issue | Environment | Metrics | Status | Link |
   
   [Continue for Medium and Low with definitions at section headers]
   
   ## Fix Patterns & Lessons Learned
   ## Statistics (Time to Fix, Environment Distribution, Root Causes)
   ```

4. **Quick Reference Card**:
   ```markdown
   🔴 Critical: Data loss | Security | Prod down | >50% perf hit
   🟠 High: Memory leak >25%/day | 25-50% perf | >10% users
   🟡 Medium: 10-25% perf | UX disrupted | Non-critical broken
   🟢 Low: <10% perf | Cosmetic | Code quality
   Remember: Dev issues -2 levels (except security)
   ```

**Migration Path**:
- Review all issues in `post-implementation-fixes/`
- Reclassify using new objective criteria
- Move files to correct severity subdirectories
- Update/create README.md with template above

**Full Proposal Available**: `docs/documentation_process_guide/SEVERITY_DEFINITIONS_PROPOSAL.md`

### 4. Implementation Report Content Structure ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Main reports become bloated with details.

**Solution**: Table of Contents style navigation hub:

```markdown
# [Feature] Implementation Report

**Implementation Plan**: [Link](../Implementation-Plan.md)
**Date Started**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Date Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration**: ~X hours/days (optional)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  <!-- Critical phase marker -->

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences maximum. No more.]

## Quick Status
✅ Delivered on time
✅ All tests passing
✅ Performance targets met

- ✅ Acceptance criteria verified via checkmarks only
- ✅ Metrics table present and minimal
- ✅ Directory structure matches: feature/reports/, feature/implementation-details/, feature/post-implementation-fixes/

### 5. Post-Implementation Fixes Index ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: No overview of fixes without opening multiple folders.

**Solution**: Mandatory README.md in post-implementation-fixes/:

```markdown
# Post-Implementation Fixes Index

**Total Fixes**: X
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status Summary**: 🔴 Critical: 0 | 🟠 High: 1 | 🟡 Medium: 1 | 🟢 Low: 1

## Quick Navigation

### 🔴 Critical (0)
*No critical issues*

### 🟠 High Priority (1)
| Date | Issue | Status | Link |
|------|-------|--------|------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Description | ✅ Fixed | [Details](./high/file.md) |

[Continue for Medium and Low]

## Fix Patterns
[Common issues identified]
```

### 6. Meta-Documentation Handling  

**Problem**: Documentation about documentation mixed with feature docs.

**Solution**:
```markdown
## Meta-Documentation Location
Documentation about the documentation process goes in:
/docs/meta/
├── guide-updates/
├── compliance-checks/
└── process-improvements/

NOT in feature directories!
```

### 7. LLM Safety Guardrails (NOT NEEDED)

**Problem**: No clear stop conditions or forbidden actions.

**Solution**:
```markdown
## STOP Conditions (LLM Must Stop)
- Tests fail 3+ times on same issue
- Conflicting instructions in guide
- About to modify files outside feature directory
- Status: COMPLETE but asked to modify implementation-details/
- Severity classification unclear
- Creating files but unsure of correct location

## Forbidden Actions (Never Do)
- Modify files outside feature directory without permission
- Change Status from COMPLETE back to IN PROGRESS
- Add to implementation-details/ after Status: COMPLETE
- Mix meta-documentation with feature documentation
- Delete or rename completed documentation
- Apply deprecated rules from previous versions
```

### 8. Implementation Status Stages ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Limited status options don't reflect actual workflow.

**Solution**:
```markdown
## Implementation Status Values
- 📝 PLANNED - Plan exists, work not started
- 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Active implementation
- 🧪 TESTING - Implementation done, verifying
- ✅ COMPLETE - All criteria met, implementation phase ends
- ❌ BLOCKED - Cannot proceed, needs human 
- 🔄 ROLLBACK - Implementation failed, reverting

Transition Rules:
- Can only move to COMPLETE from TESTING
- Once COMPLETE, cannot go backward
- BLOCKED requires human intervention note
```

### 9. Patches Directory Management ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Patches directory exists but usage unclear.

**Solution**:
```markdown
## Patches Directory (Optional)
patches/
├── implementation/     # During implementation phase
└── post-impl/         # After Status: COMPLETE

Rules:
- Patches are OPTIONAL
- Each patch must have corresponding documentation
- Use git format for compatibility
- Include patch creation date in filename
```

## Implementation Priority

### 🔥 Phase 1: Critical (Immediate)
1. Standard Feature Directory Structure
2. Single Source of Truth (deprecation handling)
3. Clear Severity Definitions
4. LLM Safety Guardrails

### ⚡ Phase 2: High (Next)
5. Implementation Report Structure
6. Post-Implementation Fixes Index
7. Meta-Documentation Handling

### 💡 Phase 3: Medium (Follow-up)
8. Implementation Status Stages
9. Patches Directory Rules

## Migration from v1.3.0 to v1.4.0

### For Existing Documentation
1. Move inline fixes to post-implementation-fixes/
2. Create README.md indexes in fix directories
3. Simplify main implementation reports
4. Move meta-documentation out of feature directories

### For LLMs
1. Check version at top of guide
2. Follow Active Rules section only
3. Ignore deprecated rules
4. Stop if encountering contradictions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No contradictory rules in active section
- [ ] All severity levels have objective criteria
- [ ] Clear phase boundaries (implementation vs post)
- [ ] LLM stop conditions documented
- [ ] All directories have clear purposes
- [ ] Index files in multi-folder structures
- [ ] Meta-documentation separated
- [ ] Migration path from v1.3.0 clear

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Reduced Confusion**: LLMs won't encounter contradictions
2. **Improved Safety**: Clear stop conditions prevent errors
3. **Better Organization**: Files go in predictable locations
4. **Easier Navigation**: Indexes provide overview
5. **Clear Evolution**: Understanding of why rules changed

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create v1.4.0 of DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS_GUIDE.md
3. Test with sample feature documentation
4. Migrate existing documentation
5. Monitor for new issues

## Appendix: Problem Examples from Real Usage

### Example 1: Interval-Free-Batch-Cleanup Confusion
- 147% CPU fix incorrectly labeled as "post-implementation fix"
- Was actually the main implementation
- Caused by unclear phase boundaries

### Example 2: Expert Review Placement
- Disconnect cleanup inline in main report (v1.2 style)
- Should have been in post-implementation-fixes/ (v1.3 style)
- Caused by contradictory rules

### Example 3: Meta-Documentation Pollution
- Documentation guide updates mixed with feature docs
- No clear guidance on where to put process improvements
- Resulted in cluttered feature directories

These real examples demonstrate why v1.4.0 improvements are necessary.

---

## Key Principles Behind v1.4.0

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- One file to rule them all
- Active rules clearly separated from history
- Migration paths included

### 2. Objective Over Subjective
- Severity based on measurable criteria
- Environment impacts clearly defined
- No guesswork required

### 3. Navigation-First Design
- Indexes mandatory for multi-folder structures
- Main reports as dashboards, not novels
- Links to details, not embedded details

### 4. Safety by Default
- Clear stop conditions for LLMs
- Forbidden actions explicitly listed
- Phase boundaries enforced

### 5. Learn from Mistakes
- Deprecation reasons documented
- Evolution table shows what changed and why
- Real examples illustrate problems

---

## Template Examples

### Perfect Main Report Length
A main report should be readable in 1-2 minutes. If someone needs more detail:
- Technical details → implementation-details/
- Evidence/logs → implementation-details/artifacts/
- Problems found later → post-implementation-fixes/

### What NOT to Include in Main Report
❌ DON'T Include:
1. Actual code snippets (link to implementation-details/)
2. Detailed step-by-step procedures (link to implementation-details/)
3. Long command outputs (link to artifacts/)
4. Detailed file diffs (link to implementation-details/)
5. Investigation narratives ("First I tried X, then Y...")
6. Debug logs (link to artifacts/)
7. Inline fix code (link to post-implementation-fixes/)

### The Main Report Serves Three Purposes
1. **Project Management View**
   - Did we deliver what was planned? ✅
   - How long did it take? X hours
   - What's the status? COMPLETE
   - Any issues after delivery? See post-implementation fixes

2. **Phase Transition Marker**
   - THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE
   - When Status = COMPLETE, implementation phase ends
   - Creates clear boundary for what's "implementation" vs "fix"

3. **Navigation Hub**
   - Points to implementation details
   - Points to artifacts
   - Points to post-implementation fixes
   - Reader can dive deep IF they want
