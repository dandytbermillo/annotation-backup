+8) Patches Directory (Optional)
+- Location: `docs/proposal/<feature_slug>/patches/` (flat directory per feature)
+- Purpose: Store proposed code changes as `git format-patch` files when direct edits are not appropriate
+- When to use (any of):
+  - Requires review/approval before merge (e.g., expert review)
+  - Risky or reversible change where a precise audit trail matters
+  - External contributor's change or cross-repo coordination
+- Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.patch` (e.g., `2025-09-03-fix-memory-leak.patch`)
+- Documentation: Maintain a single `patches/README.md` index explaining each patch (what/why/how to apply)
