# Conversation Summary — Offline Sync Foundation (2025-08-30T233211)

## Mode and Scope
- Read-only advisory mode: propose diffs only; no writes/install; await explicit approval.
- Repository focus: `docs/proposal/offline_sync_foundation/` implementation and tests.

## Initial Findings
- Migrations/Schema: `unaccent`, `pg_trgm` present; `document_saves` has `document_text` + `search_vector` with GIN/trigram indexes; `offline_queue` enforces unique `idempotency_key`; `offline_dead_letter` uses `error_message`, `retry_count`, `last_error_at`.
- Test mismatches identified:
  - Status “completed” vs actual delete-on-success (pending→processing→delete).
  - Dead-letter fields `reason`/`error_details` and `failed_at` vs schema’s `error_message`/`retry_count`/`last_error_at`.
  - FK seeding for `document_saves` (needs valid `notes(id)`); some tests lacked seeds.
  - Duplicate handling required reusing the same `idempotency_key`.

## Patches Proposed and Verified
- Manual Test Runbook (`test_pages/offline-sync-smoke.md`, `test_pages/README.md`):
  - Added preflight, DB verification queries, admin key usage, `depends_on` test, dead-letter triage, API/DB quick checks, observability/performance sampling, acceptance gates, and troubleshooting.
- Test Scripts:
  - `comprehensive-feature-test.js` and `...-fixed.js`:
    - Status flow corrected to pending→processing→delete (removed `completed`).
    - Dead-letter aligned to `error_message` and `retry_count`.
    - Replaced invalid literals with valid enums/table names and UUIDs.
    - FK seeding for `notes` before `document_saves`; added cleanup (including final missing cleanup in “Version size calculation”).
  - `sql-validation.sql`:
    - Replaced `failed_at` with `last_error_at`.
    - Removed `status='completed'` and `processed_at` queries; updated performance/timeline queries accordingly.
- Documentation (`test_scripts/README.md`):
  - Clear guidance on queue statuses, dead-letter schema, idempotency, common issues, and changes (“Final Patches 2025-08-31”).

## Folder Canonicalization
- CLAUDE.md updated to use `test_pages/` (manual) and `test_scripts/` (scripts).
- Verified `test_page/` does not exist; `test_pages/` is canonical.

## HTML Test Page
- Available at `public/offline-sync-test.html` → `http://localhost:3000/offline-sync-test.html`.
- 19 tests across Offline Queue, Search, Versions, and API.
- Dead-letter test now accepts `400/401/404` as valid (empty ids, auth required, or not found) — reduces false failures.
- 100% pass is feasible with a healthy environment.
  - Note: some Version tests are endpoint-existence smoke checks (not deep functional assertions).

## Validation Guidance
- Stronger verification:
  - `node docs/proposal/offline_sync_foundation/test_scripts/comprehensive-feature-test-corrected.js`
  - `psql -d annotation_dev -f docs/proposal/offline_sync_foundation/test_scripts/sql-validation.sql`
- To capture HTML results, run the console snippet to aggregate PASS/FAIL and share the JSON for analysis.

## Status and Next Steps
- Status: Tests and docs aligned with schema; manual runbook comprehensive; HTML page green when endpoints healthy.
- Optional:
  - Consolidate any duplication under `test_pages/`.
  - Add “canonical path” notices as needed.
  - Capture performance timings to substantiate “fast response”.

## Key Evidence (selected)
- Enum: `offline_operation_status` = pending, processing, failed (`migrations/004_offline_queue.up.sql`).
- Dead-letter schema with `last_error_at` (`migrations/011_offline_queue_reliability.up.sql`).
- FTS: `pm_extract_text`, `document_text`, `search_vector`, trigram index (`migrations/010_document_saves_fts.up.sql`).
- API routes: health, search, queue flush, export/import, dead-letter requeue/discard exist.
