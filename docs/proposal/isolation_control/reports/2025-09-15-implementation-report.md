# Isolation Control System Implementation Report
Date: 2025-09-15

## Summary
Successfully integrated the isolation control system into the annotation canvas application following Option A (offline mode, no Yjs) requirements from CLAUDE.md. The implementation provides a feature-flagged, minimal, safe isolation system that can automatically suspend unresponsive components to maintain canvas performance.

## Changes

### Files Modified

1. **components/canvas/enhanced-control-panel.tsx**
   - Added isolation state management hooks
   - Integrated with window.__isolationDebug API
   - Created isolation control UI in the 'isolation' tab
   - Added FPS monitoring and performance metrics display
   - Added enable/disable toggle for isolation system
   - Added isolated components list with restore functionality
   - Added threshold settings display (30 FPS, 2s auto-restore, max 2 components)

2. **components/canvas/enhanced-minimap.tsx**
   - Added isolatedComponents state tracking
   - Added monitoring effect to check isolation status every 500ms
   - Updated drawing logic to show isolated components with:
     - Yellow transparent fill (rgba(250, 204, 21, 0.4))
     - Diagonal stripe pattern for visual distinction
     - Dashed yellow border with thicker stroke
   - Added isolatedComponents to drawMinimap dependencies

3. **components/canvas/isolation-controls.tsx** (Created initially, then deprecated)
   - Initially created as standalone component
   - Functionality merged into enhanced-control-panel.tsx per user guidance

### Files Read/Reviewed
- lib/isolation/context.tsx - IsolationProvider implementation
- lib/isolation/types.ts - Type definitions
- components/canvas/component-panel.tsx - Component integration with isolation
- components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx - IsolationProvider wrapper

### Test Files Created
- docs/proposal/isolation_control/test_scripts/test-isolation.html
  - Manual and automated test suite for isolation API
  - Tests enable/disable, isolate/restore, multiple isolations
  - Visual status indicators and logging

## Features Implemented

1. **Control Panel Integration**
   - Isolation tab with full controls
   - Real-time FPS monitoring (color-coded: green >50, yellow 30-50, red <30)
   - Visual FPS bar showing performance percentage
   - Enable/disable toggle for isolation system
   - "Isolate Unresponsive" button (disabled when system off)
   - "Restore All" button for bulk restoration
   - List of isolated components with individual restore buttons

2. **Minimap Visual Indicators**
   - Isolated components shown with yellow striped pattern
   - Distinctive dashed border for isolated components
   - Pattern updates in real-time as components are isolated/restored

3. **Performance Metrics Display**
   - Current FPS with color coding
   - Performance status text (optimal/moderate/degraded)
   - Auto-isolation indicator when FPS drops below 30
   - Settings preview showing thresholds

## Validation Results

### Development Server
- ✅ Server started successfully on port 3002
- ✅ Database migrations up to date (17 migrations)
- ✅ All required tables present

### TypeScript Validation
- ⚠️ Type errors found in unrelated file (context-os/example/tiptap-editor.ts)
- ✅ No type errors in isolation implementation files

### Feature Testing
- ✅ Isolation API available via window.__isolationDebug
- ✅ Control panel shows isolation controls
- ✅ FPS monitoring works correctly
- ✅ Test HTML page created for validation

## Configuration

Following Option A requirements:
- Feature-flagged with `enabled: false` by default in IsolationProvider
- No Yjs runtime or CRDT logic
- PostgreSQL-only persistence (no IndexedDB)
- Debug API exposed for testing without UI changes

## Known Limitations

1. Isolation is currently disabled by default (as designed)
2. Auto-isolation thresholds are fixed (30 FPS, 2s restore delay)
3. Component priority is based on simple DOM node count heuristic
4. Maximum 2 components can be isolated simultaneously

## Next Steps

1. Enable isolation in production when ready
2. Add user preferences for thresholds
3. Implement more sophisticated performance heuristics
4. Add telemetry for isolation events
5. Consider database persistence of isolation preferences

## Testing Instructions

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3002
3. Open control panel (visible by default)
4. Switch to "Isolation" tab
5. Click "Enabled" button to activate system
6. Add multiple components to test isolation
7. Open test page: docs/proposal/isolation_control/test_scripts/test-isolation.html

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ Isolation controls integrated into existing control panel
✅ Visual indicators in minimap for isolated components  
✅ Performance metrics displayed (FPS, status)
✅ Feature-flagged implementation (disabled by default)
✅ Debug API available for testing
✅ Following Option A architecture (no Yjs, offline mode)
