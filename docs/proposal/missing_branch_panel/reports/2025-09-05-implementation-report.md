# Implementation Report: Missing Branch Panel

**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Feature**: missing_branch_panel  
**Status**: PLANNED â†’ BLOCKED

## Summary

Investigation into missing branch panel functionality in the annotation system. The branch panel is a critical UI component for managing note/explore/promote workflows but is currently not rendering correctly.

## Problem Description

Users reported that the branch panel component fails to appear when:
1. Creating new annotations
2. Switching between annotation branches
3. Attempting to promote explorations to notes

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Results
1. **Component Missing**: `BranchPanel.tsx` component not found in codebase
2. **Import Errors**: References to branch panel in canvas components fail
3. **Schema Issue**: Database schema lacks branch relationship tracking

### Technical Details
```typescript
// Expected but missing:
import { BranchPanel } from '@/components/canvas/BranchPanel';

// Current workaround:
// Branch functionality disabled in UI
```

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Stub Component Created**: Basic placeholder added
2. **Schema Update**: Added branch tracking columns (migration pending)
3. **UI Workaround**: Temporary inline controls added

## Current Status: BLOCKED

### Blocking Issues
1. **Design Specifications Missing**: No mockups or UX flow defined
2. **Data Model Incomplete**: Branch relationships need schema design
3. **Dependencies**: Requires panel management system completion

## Temporary Workaround

Users can manually manage branches using:
```sql
-- Manual branch creation
INSERT INTO annotations (note_id, type, content)
VALUES (?, 'explore', ?);
```

## Required Actions

1. **UX Design**: Create wireframes for branch panel
2. **Schema Design**: Define branch relationship model
3. **Component Development**: Build BranchPanel.tsx
4. **Integration**: Wire into canvas system
5. **Testing**: E2E tests for branch workflows

## Risk Assessment

- **High Impact**: Core workflow feature missing
- **User Experience**: Significantly degraded without branch UI
- **Timeline Risk**: Blocks other annotation features

## Escalation

This issue requires:
1. Product decision on branch workflow design
2. UX/Design team involvement
3. Potential scope adjustment for initial release

## Next Steps

**Recommended**: 
1. Schedule design review meeting
2. Define MVP branch functionality
3. Create detailed technical specification
4. Unblock with simplified implementation

**Alternative**:
- Ship without branch panel in v1
- Add as fast-follow feature
- Focus on core annotation without branching

## Dependencies

Waiting on:
- Product requirements clarification
- UX mockups
- Panel management system completion
