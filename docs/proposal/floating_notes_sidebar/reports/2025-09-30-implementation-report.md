# Implementation Report: Floating Notes Sidebar

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Feature Slug:** floating_notes_sidebar
**Status:** Implementation Complete, Testing Pending

## Summary
Converted the notes sidebar from being fixed on the note layer (left side of screen) to a floating, draggable widget that appears on right-click, similar to the PostgreSQL Persistence Monitor widget.

## Requirements Met
1. ✅ Removed notes sidebar from note layer (left side)
2. ✅ Created floating notes widget component
3. ✅ Widget appears when user right-clicks on any canvas
4. ✅ Widget is draggable (not fixed position)
5. ✅ Widget has same functionality as current notes sidebar
6. ✅ Note layer area is now empty (ready for settings in future)

## Changes Made

### Files Created
1. **`components/floating-notes-widget.tsx`** - New floating, draggable widget component
   - Accepts `initialX`, `initialY` position props (where right-click occurred)
   - Implements drag behavior using mouse events
   - Contains NotesExplorerPhase1 component
   - High z-index (15000) to appear above canvases
   - Drag handle with grip icon for clear affordance

### Files Modified
1. **`components/annotation-app.tsx`**
   - **Imports:** Changed from `NotesExplorerPhase1` to `FloatingNotesWidget`, added `useCallback`
   - **State removed:**
     - `isNotesExplorerOpen`
     - `isMouseNearEdge`
     - `sidebarHideTimer` ref
   - **State added:**
     - `showNotesWidget` - controls visibility of floating widget
     - `notesWidgetPosition` - tracks where widget should appear (x, y)
   - **Functions removed:**
     - `openNotesExplorer()`
     - `closeNotesExplorer()`
     - `handleSidebarMouseEnter()`
     - `handleSidebarMouseLeave()`
   - **Functions added:**
     - `handleContextMenu()` - shows widget at right-click position
     - `handleCloseNotesWidget()` - hides widget
   - **Rendering changes:**
     - Removed entire sidebar panel (lines 168-216 in old version)
     - Removed toggle button on left edge
     - Removed backdrop overlay
     - Added `onContextMenu` handler to main div
     - Added `FloatingNotesWidget` rendering when `showNotesWidget` is true
     - Updated welcome message to say "Right-click anywhere to open Notes Explorer"
     - Set `isNotesExplorerOpen={false}` prop on ModernAnnotationCanvas

### Files Backed Up
- `components/annotation-app.tsx.backup`
- `components/notes-explorer-phase1.tsx.backup`

## Technical Details

### Floating Widget Implementation
The floating widget uses React's built-in drag handling:
1. **Drag Start:** Captures mouse offset relative to widget top-left corner
2. **Drag Move:** Updates position based on mouse movement minus offset
3. **Drag End:** Clears dragging state
4. **Position:** Uses fixed positioning with calculated x, y coordinates
5. **Z-Index:** 15000 (higher than monitor widget's 9999)

### Integration Points
- Widget wraps `NotesExplorerPhase1` component with same props
- `onNoteSelect` callback passed through from AnnotationApp
- Right-click on any part of the canvas triggers widget display
- Widget appears at cursor position when right-clicking

## Testing Plan
1. ✅ Create backups before editing
2. ✅ Type-check passes for modified files (existing errors unrelated)
3. ⏳ Manual testing:
   - Start dev server with `npm run dev`
   - Right-click on canvas - widget should appear at cursor
   - Try dragging widget by the header - should move smoothly
   - Click X button - widget should close
   - Select a note from widget - note should load in canvas
   - Create a new note - should work as before
   - Verify note layer sidebar is gone

## Risks and Limitations
- **Breaking change:** Users expecting sidebar on left will need to learn right-click behavior
- **Discoverability:** Right-click might not be obvious to new users (welcome message helps)
- **Mobile support:** Right-click doesn't exist on touch devices (needs future work)
- **Widget persistence:** Widget position is not saved between sessions

## Next Steps
1. Manual testing in dev environment
2. Add keyboard shortcut to toggle widget (e.g., Cmd+B or Cmd+N)
3. Consider adding a small floating button/icon as alternative trigger
4. Save widget position to localStorage for persistence
5. Add touch/long-press support for mobile
6. Implement settings functionality in the now-empty note layer area

## Commands to Test
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# Right-click anywhere on canvas
# Verify widget appears at cursor position
# Test dragging widget by header
# Test note selection and creation
```

## Validation Status
- **Type-check:** ✅ No new errors introduced
- **Manual test:** ⏳ Pending
- **Integration test:** ⏳ Pending
- **E2E test:** ⏳ Pending
