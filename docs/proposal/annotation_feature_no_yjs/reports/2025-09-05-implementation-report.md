# Implementation Report: Annotation Feature (No Yjs)

**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Feature**: annotation_feature_no_yjs  
**Status**: PLANNED â†’ IN_PROGRESS

## Summary

This feature implements the core annotation system without Yjs integration (Option A as per CLAUDE.md). The system provides offline-capable annotation functionality using PostgreSQL persistence.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- PostgreSQL schema for annotations
- Basic annotation CRUD operations
- TipTap editor integration (plain mode)
- Offline adapter architecture

### In Progress
- Canvas-based panel management
- Branch-based annotation workflows
- Testing suite completion

## Architecture Decisions

1. **No Yjs Runtime**: Following Option A requirements, no live CRDT or Yjs imports
2. **PostgreSQL-Only**: All persistence through Postgres, no IndexedDB fallback
3. **Adapter Pattern**: Clean separation between storage and UI layers

## Files Modified

- `lib/adapters/annotation-offline-adapter.ts` - Core adapter implementation
- `components/canvas/tiptap-editor-plain.tsx` - Editor without Yjs
- `migrations/*.sql` - Database schema

## Testing

- Unit tests: In progress
- Integration tests: Pending Postgres setup
- E2E tests: Not started

## Known Issues

- Panel positioning needs refinement
- Branch workflow UI incomplete
- Performance optimization needed for large documents

## Next Steps

1. Complete panel management system
2. Implement branch workflow (note/explore/promote)
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Performance profiling and optimization

## Migration Path

When transitioning to Option B (with Yjs):
- Adapter interfaces remain unchanged
- Add Yjs provider alongside existing adapter
- Schema already compatible with CRDT storage

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Core functionality working
- **Medium Risk**: Performance at scale untested
- **Mitigated**: Architecture allows easy Yjs addition later
