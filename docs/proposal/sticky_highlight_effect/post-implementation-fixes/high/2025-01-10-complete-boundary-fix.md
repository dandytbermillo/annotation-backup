# Fix Report: Complete Boundary Fix

**Date**: 2025-01-10  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Category**: Functional Bug

## Summary
After initial fixes, the sticky highlight issue returned when all plugins were re-enabled. The final solution required handling both START and END boundaries explicitly in a single plugin while maintaining `keepOnSplit: false` for Enter key control.

## Files Modified

| File | Changes | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `components/canvas/annotation-start-boundary-fix.ts` | Extended to handle both boundaries | Ensure both start and end work with all plugins |
| `components/canvas/tiptap-editor-plain.tsx` | Added `keepOnSplit: false`, removed `inclusive: false` | Correct configuration for desired behavior |

## Root Cause and Fix

### Root Cause
When all plugins were re-enabled (AnnotationDecorations, PerformanceMonitor), the end boundary stopped working correctly. The interaction between plugins and default behavior caused inconsistent boundary handling.

### The Fix
Extended the boundary fix plugin to handle BOTH start and end boundaries explicitly:

```typescript
// Check START boundary
if (nodeAfter && nodeAfter.marks.some(m => m.type === annType)) {
  // Apply annotation mark
}

// Check END boundary  
if (nodeBefore && nodeBefore.marks.some(m => m.type === annType)) {
  // Apply annotation mark
}
```

Configuration:
- Removed `inclusive: false` (let plugin handle everything)
- Keep `keepOnSplit: false` (prevent Enter extension)

## Validation

### Test Matrix

| Scenario | Expected | Result |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Type at annotation START | Extends highlight | ✅ Pass |
| Type at annotation END | Extends highlight | ✅ Pass |
| Type INSIDE annotation | Continues highlight | ✅ Pass |
| Type OUTSIDE annotation | Plain text | ✅ Pass |
| Press Enter at boundaries | New line not highlighted | ✅ Pass |
| All plugins enabled | Everything works | ✅ Pass |

### Test Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Manual browser testing required
# No automated tests for boundary behavior yet
```

## Deviations From Implementation Plan

The plan suggested using TipTap's built-in mark properties (`inclusive`, `keepOnSplit`). The final solution:
- Relies primarily on custom plugin logic
- Only uses `keepOnSplit: false` from built-in properties
- Handles all boundary logic explicitly rather than declaratively

**Rationale**: Built-in properties were insufficient and interacted poorly with other plugins.

## Follow-ups/TODOs

1. ⏳ Add automated tests for boundary behavior
2. ⏳ Consider refactoring plugin name from `AnnotationStartBoundaryFix` to `AnnotationBoundaryFix`
3. ⏳ Apply to collab editor for consistency
