# Add Dark Mode

**Feature Slug**: dark_mode  
**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Status**: üìù PLANNED  
**Author**: Development Team

## Objective

Implement a dark mode toggle in the application settings that allows users to switch between light and dark themes, with preference persistence across sessions.

## Background

Users have requested a dark mode option for better visibility in low-light conditions and to reduce eye strain during extended use. This feature will improve accessibility and user experience by providing theme customization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dark mode toggle appears in application settings
- [ ] Toggle switches between light and dark themes instantly
- [ ] User preference persists across browser sessions
- [ ] All UI components properly support dark theme colors
- [ ] Contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards in dark mode
- [ ] System preference detection (prefers-color-scheme) as default
- [ ] Smooth transition animation between themes (< 300ms)

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Create theme context provider for global theme state
- [ ] Define dark theme color palette and CSS variables
- [ ] Implement toggle component in settings panel
- [ ] Add localStorage persistence for theme preference
- [ ] Update all components with theme-aware styling
- [ ] Add system preference detection on initial load
- [ ] Implement smooth transition animations
- [ ] Test contrast ratios and accessibility
- [ ] Add theme toggle keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + D)
- [ ] Update documentation with theme customization guide

## Technical Approach

Use CSS variables for theme colors, React Context for state management, and localStorage for persistence. Implement using Tailwind's dark mode class strategy with smooth transitions.

## Dependencies

- React Context API for state management
- Tailwind CSS dark mode utilities
- LocalStorage API for persistence
- CSS transitions for animations

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Inconsistent styling across components
  - **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive theme testing checklist
  
- **Risk**: Performance impact from re-rendering
  - **Mitigation**: Use React.memo and optimize context updates
  
- **Risk**: Accessibility issues with color contrast
  - **Mitigation**: Test with WCAG tools and screen readers

## Success Metrics

- 100% of components support dark mode
- Theme toggle completes within 300ms
- Zero accessibility violations in dark mode
- User preference persistence works 100% of time
- Positive user feedback on implementation

## Out of Scope

- Custom theme creation beyond light/dark
- Per-component theme overrides
- Scheduled theme switching
- Multiple dark theme variants

## Notes

Consider adding a preview option in settings to test theme before applying. May want to add transition disable option for users who prefer instant switching.
