## Review Summary

The expert reviewed the Interval-Free Batch Cleanup implementation and identified both agreements and disagreements with the implementation report.

## Agreements (Confirmed Working)
- ✅ Patches applied to all three batch routes using lazy cleanup with per-process singleton
  - app/api/postgres-offline/documents/batch/route.ts
  - app/api/postgres-offline/branches/batch/route.ts
  - app/api/postgres-offline/panels/batch/route.ts
- ✅ Node runtime: Each batch route exports `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`
- ✅ No timers in routes: No setInterval remains under app/api/postgres-offline

## Disagreements Identified

### Critical Issue: HybridSyncManager cleanup
**Expert's Finding**: 
> "The report claims interval tracking and cleanup were added, but in code disconnect() does not clear the qualityInterval. This is still missing and should be added to prevent leaks"

**Required Fix**:
```typescript
if (this.qualityInterval) { 
  clearInterval(this.qualityInterval); 
  this.qualityInterval = null;
}
```

### Documentation Path Issue
**Expert's Finding**:
> "The exact file named in the report `docs/proposal/Interval_Free_Batch_Cleanup/fixing_doc/2025-09-02-interval-free-success-report.md` was not found."

**Actual Paths Found**:
- reports/2025-09-02-interval-free-implementation-report.md
- fixing_doc/2025-09-02-implementation-report.md

## Performance Claims
**Expert's Note**:
> "The '147% → 0.1% CPU' claim is plausible given removing accumulating timers, but I can't verify those numbers here."

## Expert's Recommendation
> "Apply the small missing fix to lib/sync/hybrid-sync-manager.ts so disconnect() clears the interval as documented."

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: High - Memory leak potential in production
- **Scope**: Limited to HybridSyncManager instances
- **Risk**: Accumulating intervals if managers are created/destroyed frequently
