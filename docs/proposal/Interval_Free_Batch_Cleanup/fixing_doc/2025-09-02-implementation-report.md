# Interval-Free Batch Cleanup Implementation Report

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Duration**: In Progress  
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS  

## Executive Summary
Implementing the Interval-Free Batch Cleanup solution to fix high CPU usage caused by setInterval accumulation in batch API routes during development with HMR.

## Problem Statement
- Next.js processes consuming 145%+ CPU due to accumulated setInterval timers
- Each hot reload creates new intervals without clearing old ones
- Affects 3 batch routes and hybrid-sync-manager

## Implementation Plan
Following the approved plan in [Interval-Free-Batch-Cleanup.md](../Interval-Free-Batch-Cleanup.md)

## Tasks
1. ‚è≥ Apply api-documents-batch-no-interval.patch
2. ‚è≥ Apply api-branches-batch-no-interval.patch  
3. ‚è≥ Apply api-panels-batch-no-interval.patch
4. ‚è≥ Apply api-batch-runtime-node.patch
5. ‚è≥ Apply hybrid-sync-manager-clear-interval.patch
6. ‚è≥ Verify implementation
7. ‚è≥ Test functionality

## Pre-Implementation State
- Multiple Next.js processes with high CPU usage
- setInterval present in 3 batch routes
- No cleanup mechanism for intervals
