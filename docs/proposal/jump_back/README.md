# Jump-Back Fix Documentation

**Feature Slug:** `jump_back`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-09-16

## Overview

This folder documents the fix for the "jump-back" or "snap-back" issue where canvas panels and components would unexpectedly return to their original position during dragging operations.

## Quick Summary

**Problem:** Panels jumping back during drag due to React re-renders overwriting direct DOM manipulations.

**Solution:** Added `renderPosition` state to keep React's virtual DOM synchronized with DOM changes during drag.

**Result:** Smooth, reliable dragging without any snap-back behavior.

## Key Insight

The issue was a classic React anti-pattern: mixing imperative DOM manipulation with declarative rendering. The fix maintains both approaches but keeps them synchronized through state management.

## Files Modified

- `/components/canvas/canvas-panel.tsx`
- `/components/canvas/component-panel.tsx`

## How to Test

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:3000

3. Drag any panel or component around the canvas

4. Observe smooth movement without snap-back, even when:
   - Other UI elements update
   - Z-index changes
   - Isolation states toggle
   - Camera modes switch
