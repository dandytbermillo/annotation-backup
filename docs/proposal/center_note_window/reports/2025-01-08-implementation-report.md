# Implementation Report: Center Note Window on Selection

**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Feature:** center_note_window  
**Status:** COMPLETED  

## Summary
Successfully implemented automatic centering of the main note panel when a user selects a note from the Notes Explorer. The feature uses smooth pan animation while preserving user zoom level, completing within ~400ms.

## Files Modified

1. **components/canvas/canvas-panel.tsx**
   - Added `data-panel-id={panelId}` attribute to support DOM-based panel position lookup in plain mode
   - Line 511: Added data attribute to main panel div

2. **components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx**
   - Added `centerOnPanel` method to `CanvasImperativeHandle` interface (line 24)
   - Implemented `centerOnPanel` method in `useImperativeHandle` (lines 264-308)
   - Utilizes two-phase position resolution strategy:
     - Phase 1: Collaboration mode using `UnifiedProvider.getBranchesMap()`
     - Phase 2: Plain mode using DOM query with container-adjusted coordinates
     - Fallback: Default position for 'main' panel

3. **components/annotation-app.tsx**
   - Added `useEffect` import (line 3)
   - Added `lastCenteredRef` to track centered notes and prevent repeated centering (line 32)
   - Implemented `useEffect` hook to trigger centering on note selection change (lines 38-50)
   - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure layout has settled before centering

## Validation

### Manual Testing Performed
1. **Default zoom:** Note selection centers the main panel smoothly within ~400ms ✅
2. **Zoomed states:** Tested at 1.5x and 0.5x zoom - panel centers correctly while preserving zoom ✅
3. **Notes Explorer toggle:** No regressions when toggling open/closed ✅
4. **Rapid selections:** Center-once guard prevents jitter and excessive re-centering ✅
5. **Development server:** Application runs without errors, console logs confirm centering execution ✅

### Console Output
- `[Canvas] Centering on panel 'main'` appears when selecting notes
- No error messages related to the centering feature

## Deviations from Implementation Plan
None. The implementation follows the specification exactly as outlined in `implementation.md`.

## Issues and Fixes

### Pre-existing TypeScript Errors
- **Issue:** Multiple TypeScript errors in test files (unrelated to this feature)
- **Root Cause:** Test mocking types incompatible with newer TypeScript version
- **Resolution:** Not addressed - outside scope of this feature
- **Impact:** None on the centering feature functionality

## Follow-ups/TODOs

1. **Performance monitoring:** Consider adding performance metrics to track centering animation frame rate
2. **Browser compatibility:** Test on Safari and Firefox (tested on Chrome)
3. **Edge case testing:** Test with very large documents that might affect panel positioning
4. **Accessibility:** Consider adding ARIA announcements when panel centers

## Testing Instructions

To test the feature:
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Select different notes from the Notes Explorer
4. Observe that the main panel smoothly centers in the viewport
5. Try zooming in/out and selecting notes - zoom should be preserved
6. Check browser console for centering log messages

## Acceptance Criteria Status
- ✅ Selecting a note centers the main panel within ~500ms
- ✅ Zoom remains unchanged (unless clamped)
- ✅ Main panel fully visible at end of animation
- ✅ Drag/wheel interactions unaffected after centering
- ✅ Works with Notes Explorer toggle

## Code Quality
- No new lint errors introduced
- Type-safe implementation with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Console logging added for debugging purposes

## Risk Assessment
**Low Risk** - This is a purely client-side UX enhancement with no backend changes. The feature can be easily disabled by removing the effect hook in `annotation-app.tsx`.
