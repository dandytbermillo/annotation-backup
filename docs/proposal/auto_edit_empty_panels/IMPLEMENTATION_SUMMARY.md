# Auto-Edit Mode for Empty Panels - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Empty annotation panels were opening in read-only mode by default, requiring users to manually click "Edit" button before they could start typing.

## Solution
Implemented automatic edit mode and cursor focus for panels with empty or placeholder content.

## Changes Made

### 1. `components/canvas/canvas-panel.tsx`
- Added `isContentEmpty()` function to detect:
  - Truly empty content
  - Placeholder content ("Start writing your note/explore/promote here...")
- Auto-sets `isEditing = true` when content is empty
- Added auto-focus on mount for empty panels

### 2. `components/canvas/tiptap-editor-plain.tsx`
- Fixed editor initialization to use `isEditable` prop (was hardcoded to `true`)
- Added `autofocus: isEditable ? 'end' : false` to editor config
- Fixed `setEditable()` to actually update editor state
- Added auto-focus in `onCreate` for empty/placeholder content
- Added auto-focus when editable state changes to `true`

## Expected Behavior

When creating a new annotation:
1. Select text in main document
2. Click Note/Explore/Promote button
3. New panel opens with:
   - ✅ Edit mode enabled automatically
   - ✅ Cursor visible and blinking at the end of placeholder text
   - ✅ User can immediately start typing

## Console Output (Debug)

You should see:
```
[CanvasPanel] Initializing edit mode: {
  isEmpty: true,
  willStartInEditMode: true
}
[CanvasPanel] Auto-focusing editor for empty panel: branch-xxx
[TiptapEditorPlain] Auto-focusing empty/placeholder panel
[TiptapEditorPlain] Updating editable state to: true
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001
2. Select any text in the main document
3. Click Note/Explore/Promote to create annotation
4. Verify:
   - Panel opens in edit mode (no need to click Edit button)
   - Cursor is visible and blinking
   - You can immediately start typing

## Technical Details

### Detection Logic
The system detects "empty" content as:
- No content at all
- Only empty HTML tags (`<p></p>`)
- Default placeholder text patterns

### Focus Timing
Multiple focus attempts ensure reliability:
- On editor creation (autofocus option)
- In onCreate callback (200ms delay)
- On panel mount (300ms delay)
- When editable state changes (100ms delay)

These redundant focus calls ensure the cursor appears even if one method fails due to timing issues.
