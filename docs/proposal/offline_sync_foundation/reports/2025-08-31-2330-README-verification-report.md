| README.md | ✅ Yes | ✅ This file itself |

#### ✅ Path Accuracy
| Documented Path | Actual Status | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Original: `docs/proposal/.../test_pages/offline-sync-test.html` | ✅ Exists | Source location |
| Actual served: `http://localhost:3000/offline-sync-test.html` | ✅ Works | Copied to public/ |

#### ✅ Feature Claims (All Verified)
| Feature | Claimed | Verified |

|--------|--------------|---------|
| Queue flow | pending → processing → DELETE | ✅ Matches migration |
| Dead-letter columns | error_message, retry_count, last_error_at | ✅ Correct |
| Idempotency | Based on idempotency_key uniqueness | ✅ Verified |
| FK requirements | Must seed notes/panels first | ✅ True |

#### ✅ Commands (All Work)
```bash
# All tested and functional:
docker compose up -d postgres                    ✅
npm run dev                                      ✅
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq    ✅
open http://localhost:3000/offline-sync-test.html ✅
```

## Cross-Validation Checks

### Database Schema Alignment
- ✅ Both READMEs correctly state: NO 'completed' status
- ✅ Both correctly identify: error_message (not "reason")
- ✅ Both accurately describe: pending → processing → DELETE flow

### Test Suite Recommendations
- ✅ Both correctly recommend: comprehensive-feature-test-corrected.js
- ✅ Both properly warn about: FK constraints requiring seeding
- ✅ Both accurately document: panel_id requirement

### Common Issues Section
- ✅ All troubleshooting accurately reflects actual errors
- ✅ Solutions provided are correct and tested
- ✅ Code examples compile and run

## Minor Observations (Non-Issues)

1. **HTML Test Page Location**
   - Documented: `docs/proposal/.../test_pages/offline-sync-test.html`
   - Actually served from: `public/offline-sync-test.html`
   - **Note**: Both are correct - source vs served location

2. **Performance Claims**
   - README mentions "response time monitoring"
   - Implementation shows times but no thresholds
   - **Status**: Feature exists as documented

## Conclusion

### ✅ VERDICT: 100% VALID AND TRUTHFUL

Both README.md files are:
1. **Accurate** - All technical claims verified
2. **Complete** - All files and features documented exist
3. **Current** - Updates from 2025-08-30 and 2025-08-31 reflected
4. **Helpful** - Clear troubleshooting and examples
5. **Aligned** - Consistent with actual implementation

### Key Strengths
- Correct status flow documentation (no 'completed' myth)
- Accurate column names (error_message, not reason)
- Proper FK constraint warnings
- Clear test suite recommendations
- Comprehensive troubleshooting sections

### No Corrections Needed
The README.md files accurately represent the implementation and provide truthful, helpful documentation for users.
