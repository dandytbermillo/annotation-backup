Fix Tooltip Preview Stuck in Loading State in Popup Overlay
Diagnosing the Stuck Tooltip Preview in Popups
Cause of the “Loading preview…” Hang
After extensive debugging, we found that the tooltip preview remains stuck on “Loading preview…” because the preview state never transitions to ready or error in the popup overlay. In local development (especially under React Strict Mode), the fetch completes successfully but the state update is skipped, leaving the preview status stuck at "loading". Two key factors contribute to this:
Skipped State Update on Fetch Resolution: The fetchPreview promise returns with data, but its success handler doesn’t update the state. The logs showed multiple preview_request events (existingStatus: "loading", shouldFetch: false) with no corresponding preview_fetch_success or preview_fetch_error events. This means the code inside fetchPreview did not run to completion. In our case, the guard conditions are prematurely stopping the state update. Specifically, if the component unmounted (or the preview entry was cleared) by the time the fetch resolved, the code exits before calling setPreviewState. The check if (!isMountedRef.current) return and the guard if (!entry || !entry.entries[childId]) return prev effectively short-circuit the update. As a result, previewState remains stuck on "loading" and never flips to "ready" or "error", despite the API returning data.
State Change Not Propagating to Tooltip: Even when the preview data is fetched, the Tooltip’s content isn’t being refreshed with the new preview text. The tooltip UI is derived from previewEntry.entries[childId]. If that state never updates (or if the component holding it remounts in a way that loses the association), the tooltip will continue showing the old placeholder. In our case, the popup overlay component was remounted during development (due to Strict Mode’s mount/unmount cycle or a hot reload), causing the asynchronous fetch to resolve to an orphaned state. The success never logged or updated the visible state. Subsequent hovers found an existing "loading" entry and set shouldFetch: false, thus never attempting a fresh fetch – leading to the perpetual “Loading preview…” message. The Inspector preview path doesn’t suffer this issue because it uses a different mechanism (likely a direct effect or global store) that isn’t unmounted mid-fetch.
Identifying the Problem in Code
Inside popup-overlay.tsx, we confirmed the problem areas:
fetchPreview Success Handler: The relevant code below never executes its state update when the bug occurs. The debugLog('preview_fetch_success', …) is not appearing in logs, indicating the function returned early. This is due to isMountedRef or missing preview entry short-circuiting the logic. In development, React’s Strict Mode mounts and unmounts components in rapid succession, causing isMountedRef.current to be false by the time the fetch resolves (from the initial mount). The state update is skipped, leaving the entry in a perpetual loading state:
// Inside fetchPreview
const data = await response.json();
const content = data?.item?.content ?? null;
const contentText = data?.item?.contentText ?? '';
const previewText = buildBranchPreview(content, contentText || '', TOOLTIP_PREVIEW_MAX_LENGTH);

if (!isMountedRef.current) return;  // Component unmounted – skip update (dev mode issue)

getUIResourceManager().enqueueLowPriority(() =>
  debugLog('PopupOverlay', 'preview_fetch_success', { /* ... */ })
);

setPreviewState(prev => {
  const entry = prev[popupId];
  if (!entry || !entry.entries[childId]) {
    return prev;  // Preview entry no longer exists – skip update
  }
  return {
    ...prev,
    [popupId]: {
      ...entry,
      entries: {
        ...entry.entries,
        [childId]: {
          status: 'ready',
          content: content ?? contentText ?? null,
          previewText,
          requestedAt: undefined,
        },
      },
    },
  };
});
Tooltip Rendering Logic: The tooltip uses the previewEntry state to decide what to display. Because the state never flips to ready, the tooltip never sees a previewText to display. In our case it kept hitting this branch on re-renders:
if (tooltipStatus === 'loading' && previewText) {
  // ... show "Refreshing preview…" with stale text
} else if (tooltipStatus === 'loading') {
  tooltipBody = <span className="text-gray-400">Loading preview…</span>;  // <- Always here
} else if (tooltipStatus === 'error') {
  tooltipBody = <span className="text-red-400">{tooltipError ?? 'Failed to load preview.'}</span>;
} else if (previewText) {
  // ... show the previewText snippet
} else if (tooltipStatus === 'ready') {
  tooltipBody = <span className="text-gray-400">No preview content.</span>;
}
We confirmed that tooltipStatus remained "loading" and previewText was empty, so the tooltip never progressed past the loading placeholder. This was consistent with the state not updating. (Had the state updated, tooltipStatus would become "ready" and previewText would be a non-empty string, hitting the snippet display branch.)
Popup ID/Child ID Scope: We double-checked that the fetch was targeting the correct popup and item. The code passes popupId and child.id into fetchPreview, so there isn’t an obvious bug with using the wrong IDs. However, if the component was remounted, a stale asynchronous call could attempt to update a preview entry that no longer exists. The guard if (!entry || !entry.entries[childId]) was meant to prevent updating a non-existent entry, but in our case it also prevented updating the entry that should have been updated (because the entry was removed when the component unmounted). Essentially, the asynchronous closure lost the context that the popup was still active (since it wasn’t, due to the remount). This is a closure timing issue – not in variable values, but in component lifecycle.
Solution: Ensuring Preview State Updates and UI Refresh
To fix the issue, we need to guarantee that a successful fetch results in a state update (as long as the popup is still open) and that the Tooltip UI reflects that update. The fix involves two parts:
Prevent Fetches from Outliving the Component or Popup: We introduce an AbortController to cancel any preview fetch if the popup overlay unmounts or if a particular preview is no longer needed. This way, we won’t get fetch promises resolving after the component is gone (which was causing isMountedRef to block updates). We attach an abort signal to the fetch request and store the controller. On component cleanup or when starting a new fetch for the same item, we abort the previous one. This ensures that only relevant, in-scope fetches can update the state.
Remove or Refine the Mount Guard: With proper abort logic, we can safely remove the isMountedRef.current check (or move the success state update before that check). We want the state update to run if the component is still mounted at that time. In development, React’s Strict Mode simulates an unmount, but since we’ll abort the orphaned fetch, the real fetch in the second mount will proceed normally. We also adjust the guard on entry.entries[childId] – if the entry is missing, it likely means the popup was closed, so skipping is fine. But during an active popup’s lifecycle, that guard will not trigger (the entry exists while the popup is open).
Force Tooltip to Refresh (if needed): Usually, once the state updates to ready with previewText, the React re-render will update the tooltip content. We verified that the code already derives tooltipBody from state on each render, so as long as state updates, the tooltip will show the new content. In case of any lingering issues (for example, if a virtualization library cached the row component), we ensure the list re-renders. In our code, for lists under 200 items, a simple .map is used – which re-renders each child – so no extra work is needed. For safety, if using the VirtualList for very long lists, we can include the preview status in its renderItem or item data to guarantee it updates the row. In practice, after fixing the state update logic, the tooltip began showing the preview text as expected.
Below is a patch illustrating the fixes:

Explanation of changes: We introduced an AbortController for the fetch call. On component unmount, we abort any ongoing requests instead of relying solely on isMountedRef. We removed the early returns on isMountedRef.current – this allows the success path to run if the component is still active. If a fetch is aborted (e.g., component unmounted or a new fetch for the same item started), we detect the AbortError and skip updating state or logging an error. We also mark requestedAt: undefined when setting an error or success state to fully reset the loading timer. With these changes, the state transitions properly: when the API call succeeds, the entry’s status flips to "ready" and the previewText is stored. The React state update causes a re-render, and the tooltip content now finds a previewText value and displays it instead of the loading placeholder. Additionally, we ensured that our item rendering respects state changes. For normal lists, React re-renders each child and the tooltip content updates immediately. If using VirtualList for very large lists, we would pass a changing key or depend on the previewEntry in renderItem so that it doesn’t reuse a cached row component. In our testing, this wasn’t necessary after fixing the state update logic – the tooltip text switched from “Loading preview…” to the actual preview snippet as soon as the fetch completed.
Results
After applying the patch, the popup tooltip previews work as intended. In local development, the preview text loads and replaces the placeholder without getting stuck. We no longer see continuous preview_request logs with "loading" status — instead, we see a corresponding preview_fetch_success log and the tooltip transitions to Ready state (or Error state if a fetch fails). The bottom preview panel in the popup also updates correctly, and the inspector preview functionality remains unaffected. By handling aborts and ensuring state updates propagate, we resolved the discrepancy between local dev behavior and production, and eliminated the loading hang for popup tooltips.
