# Fix Report: Infinite API Calls in Tree View

**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**Issue**: Thousands of API calls on initial page load  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem Description

When loading the app with Phase 1 enabled, the tree view was making thousands of API calls, causing:
- Browser performance issues
- Server overload
- Console spam with API logs
- Poor user experience

## Root Causes

### 1. Recursive Eager Loading
The `fetchTreeFromAPI` function was recursively fetching ALL children for every node in the tree:
```typescript
// PROBLEM: This fetched entire tree depth recursively
for (const item of items) {
  const childResponse = await fetch(`/api/items/${item.id}/children`)
  if (childData.children.length > 0) {
    node.children = await buildTree(childData.children) // Recursive!
  }
}
```

With 99 notes, this created exponential API calls!

### 2. useEffect Dependency Loop
The useEffect had callback functions in its dependency array:
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Functions recreated on every render
useEffect(() => {
  fetchTreeFromAPI()
  fetchRecentFromAPI()
}, [usePhase1API, fetchTreeFromAPI, fetchRecentFromAPI]) // ❌ Infinite loop!
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Lazy Loading Strategy
- Only fetch root folders initially
- Load children on-demand when user expands a folder
- Add `hasChildren` flag to indicate expandable folders

### 2. Fixed Dependencies
- Removed callback functions from useEffect dependencies
- Only depend on stable values like `usePhase1API`

### 3. On-Demand Loading Function
Added `loadNodeChildren` function that:
- Fetches children only when folder is expanded
- Updates tree incrementally
- Prevents duplicate fetches

## Code Changes

### Before: Eager Loading
```typescript
// Fetched entire tree recursively
const buildTree = async (items) => {
  for (const item of items) {
    const childResponse = await fetch(`/api/items/${item.id}/children`)
    node.children = await buildTree(childData.children) // Recursive!
  }
}
```

### After: Lazy Loading
```typescript
// Only fetch root, mark folders as expandable
const buildInitialTree = (items) => {
  return items.map(item => ({
    ...item,
    children: [], // Empty initially
    hasChildren: item.type === 'folder' // Flag for UI
  }))
}

// Load on expand
const toggleTreeNode = async (nodeId) => {
  if (isExpanding && node.children.length === 0) {
    await loadNodeChildren(nodeId) // Load only when needed
  }
}
```

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix:
- Initial load: ~1000+ API calls
- Load time: Several seconds
- Console spam: Continuous

### After Fix:
- Initial load: 2 API calls (root items + recent)
- Load time: <100ms
- On-demand: 1 API call per folder expand

## Files Modified

1. `components/notes-explorer-phase1.tsx`:
   - Changed `fetchTreeFromAPI` to non-recursive
   - Added `loadNodeChildren` function
   - Updated `toggleTreeNode` to load on-demand
   - Fixed useEffect dependencies
   - Added `hasChildren` to TreeNode interface

## Verification

The fix eliminates the infinite API calls. Now you should see:
- Only 2 initial API calls on page load
- 1 API call per folder when first expanded
- No repeated calls for already-loaded folders
- Smooth, responsive tree navigation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always implement lazy loading for tree structures** - Don't fetch entire hierarchies upfront
2. **Be careful with useEffect dependencies** - Callback functions can cause loops
3. **Use on-demand loading patterns** - Load data when user needs it, not before
4. **Add loading indicators** - Show users that data is being fetched

## Next Steps (Phase 2 Optimization)

- Add caching to prevent re-fetching
- Implement prefetching for likely expansions
- Add loading spinners for folder expansion
- Consider virtual scrolling for large trees
