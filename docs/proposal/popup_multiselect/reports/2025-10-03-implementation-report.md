# Popup Multi-Select Implementation Report

**Feature:** `popup_multiselect`
**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Type-Check:** ✅ PASSED (no new errors introduced)

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented multi-select functionality for popup overlay items (notes/folders), allowing users to select multiple items within a popup using keyboard modifiers (Ctrl/Cmd+Click, Shift+Click) and perform bulk operations (Delete, Clear).

### What Was Implemented

1. **Per-popup selection state management** - Independent selection for each popup
2. **Keyboard modifier support** - Ctrl/Cmd (toggle), Shift (range), Regular (single)
3. **Visual feedback** - Selected items highlighted with indigo background
4. **Actions bar** - Delete and Clear buttons appear when items selected
5. **Parent callback integration** - Delete operations wired to API layer in annotation-app.tsx

---

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes

**1. `components/canvas/popup-overlay.tsx`**

- Added multi-select state: `popupSelections` and `lastSelectedIds` Maps
- Added cleanup effect to remove selections when popups close
- Implemented `handleItemSelect` with modifier detection
- Implemented `handleClearSelection` and `handleDeleteSelected`
- Updated `renderPopupChildRow` signature to accept children array
- Added visual selection highlight (bg-indigo-500 bg-opacity-50)
- Added actions bar rendering in both popup render paths
- Added `onDeleteSelected` prop to interface

**2. `components/annotation-app.tsx`**

- Implemented `handleDeleteSelected` callback with API delete logic
- Wired callback to `PopupOverlay` component via props

### Backup Files Created

- `components/canvas/popup-overlay.tsx.backup`
- `components/annotation-app.tsx.backup.multiselect`

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. State Management (popup-overlay.tsx:122-124)

```typescript
// Per-popup selection state
const [popupSelections, setPopupSelections] = useState<Map<string, Set<string>>>(new Map());
const [lastSelectedIds, setLastSelectedIds] = useState<Map<string, string>>(new Map());
```

**Immutability:** Always clone outer Map AND inner Set to ensure React detects changes.

### 2. Cleanup Effect (popup-overlay.tsx:523-553)

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const activeIds = new Set<string>();
  popups.forEach((_, id) => activeIds.add(id));

  setPopupSelections(prev => {
    let mutated = false;
    const next = new Map<string, Set<string>>();
    prev.forEach((selection, id) => {
      if (activeIds.has(id)) {
        next.set(id, selection);
      } else {
        mutated = true;
      }
    });
    return mutated ? next : prev;
  });
  // ... similar for lastSelectedIds
}, [popups]);
```

**Purpose:** Prevents memory leaks by removing selection state for closed popups.

### 3. Selection Handler (popup-overlay.tsx:321-411)

**Ctrl/Cmd+Click:** Toggle individual item in/out of selection
**Shift+Click:** Select range from last selected to current (within same popup)
**Regular Click:** Clear all selections, select only clicked item

### 4. Visual Feedback (popup-overlay.tsx:430, 487-488)

```typescript
const isSelected = popupSelections.get(popupId)?.has(child.id) ?? false;

className={`... ${
  isSelected ? 'bg-indigo-500 bg-opacity-50 text-white' :
  isActivePreview ? 'bg-gray-700/70 text-white' : 'text-gray-200'
}`}
```

**Precedence:** selected > activePreview > default

### 5. Actions Bar (popup-overlay.tsx:1569-1602, 1757-1790)

Rendered conditionally when `selectionCount > 0`:
- Shows count: "X items selected"
- Delete button: Calls `handleDeleteSelected` with confirmation
- Clear button: Calls `handleClearSelection`

### 6. Parent Callback (annotation-app.tsx:945-994)

```typescript
const handleDeleteSelected = useCallback(async (popupId: string, selectedIds: Set<string>) => {
  // Delete each item via API
  const deletePromises = Array.from(selectedIds).map(async (itemId) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/items/${itemId}`, { method: 'DELETE' });
    // ...
  });
  await Promise.all(deletePromises);
  // Refresh tree data (popup auto-updates)
}, [usePhase1API]);
```

## Validation & Testing

### Type-Check Results

```bash
$ npm run type-check
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
**No new errors** introduced in:
- `components/canvas/popup-overlay.tsx`
- `components/annotation-app.tsx`

All reported errors are pre-existing in unrelated files (__tests__, lib/offline, etc.).

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Recommended tests:**

- [ ] Open popup (click folder eye icon)
- [ ] Ctrl/Cmd+Click multiple notes → verify toggle selection
- [ ] Shift+Click → verify range selection within same popup
- [ ] Verify selected rows show indigo highlight
- [ ] Verify preview hover still works on selected items
- [ ] Click Delete → verify confirmation dialog
- [ ] Confirm delete → verify API calls and popup refresh
- [ ] Click Clear → verify selection cleared
- [ ] Close popup → verify selection cleared on reopen
- [ ] Test with VirtualList (>200 items) and inline list

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Per-Popup Selection Scope

**Decision:** Each popup maintains independent selection state
**Rationale:**
- Simpler UX - users select within one context
- No cross-popup operation complexity
- Matches existing notes-explorer pattern
**Alternative Rejected:** Global selection across popups (too complex)

### 2. Parent Owns Delete Logic

**Decision:** PopupOverlay emits delete request, parent (annotation-app) handles API
**Rationale:**
- Separation of concerns (UI vs data layer)
- Parent controls tree refresh
- Follows adapter/provider pattern
**Alternative Rejected:** Direct API calls in PopupOverlay (tight coupling)

### 3. Immutable State Updates

**Decision:** Always clone Map AND Set when mutating
**Rationale:**
- React requires new references to detect changes
- Prevents subtle re-render bugs
- Follows functional programming best practices

### 4. Event Propagation Control

**Decision:** stopPropagation on onClick for selection
**Rationale:**
- Prevents conflicts with preview/folder hover
- User explicitly clicks row for selection
- Eye icon still triggers preview/folder actions

---

## Risks & Limitations

### Known Limitations

1. **No Move/Organize** - Deferred to separate feature (see plan)
2. **No Keyboard Navigation** - Arrow keys not implemented yet
3. **No Drag Multiple** - Drag integration deferred
4. **Tree Refresh** - Relies on parent's tree refresh mechanism

### Potential Issues

1. **Large Selections** - Deleting 100+ items may be slow (sequential API calls)
   - **Mitigation:** Promise.all for parallel execution
   - **Future:** Batch delete API endpoint

2. **Popup Height** - Actions bar adds ~50px
   - **Mitigation:** Popup has scrollable content area
   - **Monitor:** User feedback on usability

3. **Selection Persistence** - Cleared on popup close
   - **Expected:** Matches notes-explorer behavior
   - **Future:** Could persist in URL/session if needed

---

## Follow-Up Tasks

### Immediate (Optional)

- [ ] Add visual feedback during delete (loading spinner)
- [ ] Add error toast if delete fails
- [ ] Add batch delete API endpoint for performance

### Future Features

- [ ] Drag multiple selected items to canvas
- [ ] Move selected items to different folder
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (arrow keys + Space/Enter)
- [ ] Select all / Deselect all keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Persist selection across popup close/reopen

- [x] Regular click selects single item (clears others)
- [x] Selected items show visual highlight (bg-indigo-500)
- [x] Actions bar appears when items selected
- [x] Delete button removes selected items with confirmation
- [x] Clear button deselects all items
- [x] Selection cleared when popup closes
- [x] Type-check passes with no new errors
- [x] Backups created before modifications

### Manual Testing Criteria (Pending User Testing)

- [ ] Multi-select works in production popup overlay
- [ ] No conflicts with preview/hover behavior
- [ ] No conflicts with drag/pan behavior
- [ ] No performance degradation with large lists
- [ ] Delete operations refresh popup content correctly
- [ ] No console errors during selection/delete

---

## Conclusion

Multi-select functionality successfully implemented following the refined plan. All code changes pass type-check validation with no new errors. The implementation follows existing codebase patterns (notes-explorer-phase1.tsx) and maintains proper separation of concerns (UI in PopupOverlay, API in annotation-app).

**Ready for manual testing** to verify UX and integration with live popup data.

**Next Steps:**
1. Manual testing following checklist above
2. Address any issues discovered during testing
3. Consider optional enhancements (batch delete API, error handling)
4. Plan follow-up features (drag multiple, move operations)
