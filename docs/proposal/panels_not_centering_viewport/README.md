# Panel Centering Issue Investigation

**Date Created:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** üî¥ ACTIVE - Centering not working
**Impact:** HIGH - Affects user experience when opening notes

---

## Quick Summary

When users open notes from the Recent Notes panel or organization popup, the panel appears in the **upper-left corner** of the viewport instead of being centered. Multiple fix attempts have been made, but the centering issue persists.

### What Works
‚úÖ Eliminated slide animation (panel appears instantly)
‚úÖ Canvas ref retry mechanism working
‚úÖ CSS transition successfully disabled during positioning

### What Doesn't Work
‚ùå Panel not centering in viewport
‚ùå Position varies slightly between notes
‚ùå Appears in upper-left corner consistently

## Current Hypothesis

The issue appears to be related to **viewport state management** and **storage system interaction**:

1. **Storage loads saved viewport positions** unique to each note
2. **Viewport reset logic** may not be executing before centering
3. **Auto-save** may be overriding centered position immediately
4. **Coordinate transformation** may have a bug in calculation

## How to Continue Investigation

### 1. Read the Research Plan
Start with `RESEARCH_PLAN.md` to understand:
- What we've tried
- What we've learned
- What to investigate next

### 2. Check Debug Logs
Run the app and check PostgreSQL debug logs:
```sql
SELECT component, action, metadata, timestamp
FROM debug_logs
WHERE component IN ('AnnotationApp', 'AnnotationCanvas', 'PanAnimations')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### 3. Verify Viewport State
Add console logs to confirm:
- Is viewport reset actually applied?
- What is the viewport state when `centerOnPanel` runs?
- Does storage override the centered position?

### 4. Test Centering Math
Manually calculate expected values:
```javascript
// Given:
panelX = 2000, panelY = 1500
panelWidth = 600, panelHeight = 500
viewportWidth = 1554, viewportHeight = 892
zoom = 1

// Expected:
centerOffsetX = (1554/2 - 600/2) / 1 = 477
centerOffsetY = (892/2 - 500/2) / 1 = 196

targetX = -2000 + 477 = -1523
targetY = -1500 + 196 = -1304

// Compare with actual debug log values
```

### 5. Inspect DOM After Centering
```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('infinite-canvas')
console.log('Transform:', canvas.style.transform)
console.log('Transition:', canvas.style.transition)
```

## Key Code Locations

### Centering Trigger
**File:** `components/annotation-app.tsx`
**Lines:** 719-792
**Function:** `useEffect` that calls `centerOnPanel`

### Centering Logic
**File:** `components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx`
**Lines:** 838-926
**Function:** `centerOnPanel` implementation

### Storage Loading
**File:** `components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx`
**Lines:** 294-407
**Function:** `useEffect` that loads saved state

### Canvas Transform
**File:** `components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx`
**Lines:** 1044-1059
**JSX:** `<div id="infinite-canvas" style={{...}}>`

## Debug Commands

### View Recent Debug Logs
```bash
docker exec -i annotation_postgres psql -U postgres -d annotation_dev -c \
  "SELECT component, action, metadata, timestamp FROM debug_logs \
   WHERE component IN ('AnnotationApp', 'AnnotationCanvas', 'PanAnimations') \
   ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50;"
```

### Check localStorage State
```javascript
// In browser console
const noteId = 'YOUR_NOTE_ID'
const key = `canvas_state_${noteId}`
const state = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key))
console.log('Saved state:', state)
```

### Monitor Canvas State
```javascript
// Add to annotation-canvas-modern.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Canvas state changed:', {
    translateX: canvasState.translateX,
    translateY: canvasState.translateY,
    zoom: canvasState.zoom
  })
}, [canvasState.translateX, canvasState.translateY, canvasState.zoom])
```
