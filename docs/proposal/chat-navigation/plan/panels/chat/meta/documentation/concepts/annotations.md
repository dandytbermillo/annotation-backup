# Annotations

## Overview
Annotations are branching extensions of notes. When you select text and create
a branch, you add an annotation that links to that selection. There are three
types: note, explore, and promote.

## Where it appears
- On the canvas as panels attached to selections.
- Listed in the branches section of the floating toolbar.

## Annotation types
- Note: General comments or thoughts about the selected text.
- Explore: Research branches for diving deeper into a topic.
- Promote: Highlight important content for later reference.

## Key behaviors
- Select text and use the floating toolbar to create a branch.
- Each annotation links back to its source selection.
- Annotations can have their own sub-annotations (nested branches).
- Move or resize annotation panels on the canvas.

## Example questions
- "Explain annotations"
- "What are the annotation types?"
- "How do I create a branch?"
