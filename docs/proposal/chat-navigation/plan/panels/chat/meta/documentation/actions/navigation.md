# Navigation Actions

## Overview
These actions move you between entries, dashboards, and workspaces. They are used by the chat assistant when you ask to go somewhere or open a location.

## Supported actions
- Go to the current entry dashboard
- Go to Home (the main entry dashboard)
- Open a workspace by name
- Open an entry by name
- Open the most recent workspace

## Examples
- "go to dashboard"
- "go home"
- "open workspace Sprint 6"
- "open entry summary14"
- "open recent workspace"

## Behavior notes
- If the name is ambiguous, the chat shows options as pills.
- If you are already on the requested location, the chat will say so.
- If the target is not found, the chat returns a clear "not found" message.
