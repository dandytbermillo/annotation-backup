# Workspace Actions

## Overview
Workspace actions manage and organize workspaces within the current entry. Each action is safe and scoped to the current entry unless otherwise stated.

## Supported actions
- List workspaces in the current entry
- Create a workspace
- Rename a workspace
- Delete a workspace (permanent for now)
- Switch to a workspace by name

## Examples
- "list workspaces"
- "create workspace Research"
- "rename workspace Sprint 5 to Sprint 6"
- "delete workspace Old"
- "open workspace Sprint 6"

## Behavior notes
- Deleting requires confirmation.
- If multiple workspaces match a name, the chat shows a list of options.
- Some defaults (like a Dashboard workspace) may be protected from deletion.
