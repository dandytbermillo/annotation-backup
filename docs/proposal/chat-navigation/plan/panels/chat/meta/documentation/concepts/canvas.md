## Overview
The canvas is the main annotation workspace where notes are displayed as
draggable panels. It supports branching annotations with three types: note,
explore, and promote.

## Where it appears

- Panels appear when annotations are created or expanded.

## Key behaviors
- Drag and drop panels anywhere on the canvas.
- Zoom in/out to see more or fewer panels.
- Create branches from selected text using the floating toolbar.
- Resize panels by dragging edges.
- Navigate between open notes via the dock.

## Annotation types

- Explore: Branch for exploring ideas or research.
- Promote: Branch for elevating important content.
