# Widget and Panel Actions

## Overview
Widgets and panels are the building blocks of the dashboard. The chat can open widgets as drawers and list their content in chat, depending on panel type. Each action targets a specific widget or panel.

## Supported actions
- Open a visible widget by name (drawer)
- Show Recent and Quick Links panels
- List items in a panel in chat (preview)

## Examples
- "open Navigator"
- "open Quick Capture"
- "show recent"
- "list recent in chat"
- "show quick links D"
- "list quick links D in chat"

## Behavior notes
- When multiple panels match, the chat will ask which one you want.
- Quick Links panels may have badges (A, B, C, D, E) that help disambiguate.
- If a widget does not expose a chat manifest yet, the chat may not open it.
