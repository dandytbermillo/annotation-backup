# Branch Panel Off-Screen Bug - Fix Applied
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: FIXED - Awaiting User Testing
**Files Modified**: `components/canvas/branch-item.tsx`, `components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx`, `lib/hooks/use-panel-persistence.ts`, `app/api/canvas/layout/[noteId]/route.ts`

---

## Problem Summary

**Symptom**: Creating new branch panels caused them to appear far off-screen, while opening existing branch panels worked correctly.

**Root Cause**: Double coordinate conversion bug in `calculateSmartPosition()` function within `branch-item.tsx`.

Additional behaviour uncovered during verification: closed branch panels were being resurrected on reload because panel state was never persisted. The backend still marked them `active`, and hydration always restored every active panel for the note.

---

## The Bug

The code incorrectly treated `style.left/top` values as **screen coordinates** when they actually contain **world coordinates**.

### Why This Happened

From `canvas-panel.tsx:965-966`, panels store world coordinates in DOM:
```typescript
panelRef.current.style.left = position.x + 'px'  // position is WORLD-space
panelRef.current.style.top = position.y + 'px'
```

But `calculateSmartPosition()` was treating these as screen coordinates and converting:
```typescript
// OLD BUGGY CODE (lines 140-148)
const parentScreenX = parseFloat(style.left) || 0  // ❌ Variable name says "screen" but value is world!
const parentScreenY = parseFloat(style.top) || 0
const parentWorld = screenToWorld({ x: parentScreenX, y: parentScreenY }, camera, zoom)
// ❌ Converts world→world, applying camera offset twice
```

### Impact Example

With camera at `(-1000, -1200)` and zoom `1.0`:

```
Parent panel at:     world(2000, 1500)
Expected branch at:  world(2850, 1500)  (+850px offset)

BUGGY calculation:
  Read style.left:   2000 (world, but treated as screen)
  Add offset:        2000 + 850 = 2850
  Convert to world:  (2850/1.0) - (-1000) = 3850  ❌
  Result stored:     world(3850, 2700)
  Off by:            (+1000, +1200) = exactly camera offset!
```

## Why "Opening" Worked But "Creating" Failed

### Opening Existing Panel (Lines 87-100)
```typescript
if (state.panels.has(branchStoreKey)) {
  // Just focus existing panel - NO position calculation
  const panel = state.panels.get(branchStoreKey)
  panel.element.style.zIndex = String(state.panelZIndex + 1)
  return  // Early exit
}
```
✅ **Works**: Uses existing DOM position, no coordinate calculations.

### Creating New Panel (Lines 103-289)
```typescript
// Panel doesn't exist, calculate position from parent
const calculateSmartPosition = () => {
  const parentScreenX = parseFloat(style.left) || 0  // ❌ BUG HERE
  const parentWorld = screenToWorld(...)  // ❌ Double conversion
  ...
}
```
❌ **Fails**: Buggy coordinate conversion causes off-screen placement.

## The Fix

### Changes Made

**File**: `components/canvas/branch-item.tsx`

#### 1. Fixed Parent Panel Position Reading (Lines 222-227)

**Before**:
```typescript
// Panels use absolute positioning with left/top (screen coordinates)
const parentScreenX = parseFloat(style.left) || 0
const parentScreenY = parseFloat(style.top) || 0
const camera = {
  x: state.canvasState.translateX,
  y: state.canvasState.translateY
}
const zoom = state.canvasState.zoom || 1
const parentWorld = screenToWorld({ x: parentScreenX, y: parentScreenY }, camera, zoom)
```

**After**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Panels store WORLD coordinates in style.left/top, NOT screen coordinates!
// canvas-panel.tsx:965-966 sets: panelRef.current.style.left = position.x + 'px' (world-space)
const parentWorldX = parseFloat(style.left) || 0
const parentWorldY = parseFloat(style.top) || 0
const parentWorld = { x: parentWorldX, y: parentWorldY }
const zoom = state.canvasState.zoom || 1
// No conversion needed - already in world-space
```

#### 2. Fixed Collision Detection (Lines 259-260)

**Before**:
```typescript
const otherScreenX = parseFloat(panelStyle.left) || 0
const otherWorld = screenToWorld({ x: otherScreenX, y: 0 }, camera, zoom)
```

**After**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Panel positions in style.left are WORLD coordinates, not screen!
const otherWorldX = parseFloat(panelStyle.left) || 0
// Use directly - no conversion needed
```

#### 3. Fixed Fallback Return Structure (Lines 210-216)

**Before**:
```typescript
return fallbackWorldPosition  // ❌ Type mismatch - returns {x, y} not {world, screen}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Return consistent structure with {world, screen}
const camera = { x: state.canvasState.translateX, y: state.canvasState.translateY }
const zoom = state.canvasState.zoom || 1
return {
  world: fallbackWorldPosition,
  screen: worldToScreen(fallbackWorldPosition, camera, zoom)
}
```

## Validation

### Type-Check Results
```bash
$ npm run type-check
```
✅ **No new TypeScript errors** from this fix
⚠️ Pre-existing errors remain (unrelated to coordinate system)

### Expected Behavior After Fix

**Creating a new branch panel**:
1. Parent at world(2000, 1500)
2. Calculate offset: +850px right
3. Result: world(2850, 1500) ✅
4. Store: world(2850, 1500) in dataStore ✅
5. Persist: world(2850, 1500) to database via `persistPanelCreate` ✅
6. Render: Browser applies container transform to place at correct screen position ✅

**Opening existing branch panel**:
1. Panel already in DOM with correct world position
2. Just bring to front (z-index) ✅
3. No position recalculation ✅

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests Required

- [ ] **Create new branch panel** via per-panel Tools → Branches dropdown
  - Parent panel at default camera position (-1000, -1200)
  - Verify branch appears ~850px to right of parent
  - Verify branch NOT off-screen

- [ ] **Create branch at different camera positions**
  - Pan camera to different location
  - Create branch panel
  - Verify branch appears adjacent to parent (not off-screen)

- [ ] **Reload page**
  - Branch panels should reappear in same positions
  - Connection lines should render correctly

- [ ] **Open existing branch panel**
  - Close branch panel
  - Click eye icon or branch item again
  - Verify panel appears at same position (no recalculation)

- [ ] **Multiple branch panels**
  - Create 2+ branches from same parent
  - Verify collision detection works (panels don't overlap)
  - Verify they place left/right/below as appropriate

### Database Cleanup (If Needed)

If you have existing branch panels stored with corrupted positions from the bug:

**Option 1 - Manual Test**:
```sql
-- Check current branch panel positions
SELECT panel_id, note_id, position_x_world, position_y_world, created_at
FROM panels
WHERE type='branch'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Option 2 - Delete and Recreate**:
```sql
-- Delete all branch panels (keeps main panels)
DELETE FROM panels WHERE type='branch';
```
Then recreate branch panels via UI with the fix applied.

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Create new branch panels and verify they appear correctly
2. **Verify Fix**: Confirm panels appear adjacent to parent (not off-screen)
3. **Test Reload**: Ensure panels persist and reload in correct positions
4. **Report Results**: Document whether fix resolves the issue completely

## Technical Notes

### Coordinate System Architecture

**Storage**: All panel positions stored in **world-space** (camera-independent)
- Database: `position_x_world`, `position_y_world`
- DataStore: `branchData.position`, `branchData.worldPosition`
- DOM: `style.left`, `style.top` ← **Also world-space!**

**Rendering**: Browser converts world→screen via container transform
```typescript
// annotation-canvas-modern.tsx:2734
transform: `translate3d(${canvasState.translateX}px, ${canvasState.translateY}px, 0) scale(${canvasState.zoom})`
```

**Key Insight**: DOM `style.left/top` values are **not** screen coordinates. They're world coordinates that the browser transforms during rendering.

### Why This Bug Was Hard to Catch

1. **Misleading variable names**: `parentScreenX` suggested screen coords when it was actually world
2. **Comment error**: Code comment said "screen coordinates"
3. **Opening worked**: Early return bypassed buggy calculation, masking the issue
4. **Only affected creation**: Bug only triggered when calculating new positions
