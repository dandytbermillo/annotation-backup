# Branch Panel Fixes Collection

**Issues Fixed:**
1. Closed branch panels did not reappear when reopened via eye icon ‚úÖ
2. Branch panels appeared off-screen after page reload ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ BOTH FIXED
**Date:** 2025-10-20

---

## Quick Summary

### Issue 1: Panel Reopening
When users closed a branch panel and tried to reopen it, the panel wouldn't appear because it was removed from `canvasItems` but not from `state.panels`, causing an early return check to prevent recreation.

**Fix:** Added `REMOVE_PANEL` dispatch in `handlePanelClose` to synchronize both state sources.

### Issue 2: Off-Screen Positioning
Branch panels persisted to database and hydrated on reload, but appeared off-screen because world-space coordinates from database were passed directly to rendering system expecting screen-space coordinates.

**Fix:** Added `worldToScreen()` coordinate conversion during panel hydration.

## Affected File

**File:** `components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx`
**Function:** `handlePanelClose`
**Lines:** 1787-1801

**Change:**
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Also remove panel from state.panels Map so it can be reopened later
dispatch({
  type: 'REMOVE_PANEL',
  payload: { id: panelId }
})

debugLog({
  component: 'AnnotationCanvas',
  action: 'panel_removed_from_state',
  metadata: { panelId, noteId: targetNoteId },
  content_preview: `Removed panel ${panelId} from state.panels Map`
})
```

---

## How to Verify Fix is Working

### Manual Test
1. Open branch panel ‚Üí ‚úÖ Should appear
2. Close it ‚Üí ‚úÖ Should disappear
3. Reopen it ‚Üí ‚úÖ Should appear again

### Debug Logs
```sql
-- Should see 'panel_removed_from_state' logs when closing
SELECT created_at, metadata->>'panelId', content_preview
FROM debug_logs
WHERE action='panel_removed_from_state'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Should see 'create_panel_proceeding' (NOT 'early_return') when reopening
SELECT created_at, metadata->>'panelId', content_preview
FROM debug_logs
WHERE action IN ('create_panel_early_return', 'create_panel_proceeding')
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

---

## Root Cause

The system maintains two separate panel state sources:

1. **`canvasItems`** - Modern array-based state (UI rendering)
2. **`state.panels`** - Legacy Map-based state (panel tracking)

Before the fix, closing a panel only updated `canvasItems`, leaving `state.panels` out of sync. This caused `branch-item.tsx` to think the panel still existed when trying to reopen it.

---

## Debug Timeline

1. User closes panel via X button
2. `handlePanelClose` called
3. Panel filtered out of `canvasItems` ‚úÖ
4. **Panel NOT removed from `state.panels`** ‚ö†Ô∏è (BUG)
5. User clicks eye icon to reopen
6. `branch-item.tsx` checks `state.panels.has(branchId)`
7. Check returns `true` (panel still in Map!)
8. Early return at line 87 ‚Üí Panel never created ‚ùå

---

## Evidence

Debug logs showed `handleCreatePanel` was **never called** when trying to reopen:

**Panel close logs:**
```
2025-10-20 01:57:24 | panel_close_start | Items: 3
2025-10-20 01:57:24 | panel_removed_from_items
2025-10-20 01:57:24 | panel_close_items_updated | Items: 3 ‚Üí 2
```

**Panel reopen attempt:**
```
(NO LOGS - handleCreatePanel never called!)
```

This confirmed the early return in `branch-item.tsx` was preventing panel creation.

## Testing Checklist

After applying the fix, verify:

- [ ] Type check passes: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Panel opens on first click of eye icon
- [ ] Panel closes when X button clicked
- [ ] Panel reopens on second click of eye icon
- [ ] Multiple close/reopen cycles work
- [ ] Panel content persists across cycles
- [ ] Connection lines update correctly
- [ ] Debug logs show `panel_removed_from_state` events

## Future Improvements

1. **Consolidate state sources** - Migrate from dual-state (`canvasItems` + `state.panels`) to single source of truth
2. **Add integration tests** - Automated tests for panel lifecycle
3. **State sync validation** - Dev-mode checks to detect desync issues early

## Need Help?

If panels still don't reopen:

1. Check debug logs using queries in `debug_queries.sql`
2. Look for `create_panel_early_return` events (indicates state.panels still has panel)
3. Verify `panel_removed_from_state` events exist (indicates fix is working)
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Review `branch-item.tsx` line 87 early return check
