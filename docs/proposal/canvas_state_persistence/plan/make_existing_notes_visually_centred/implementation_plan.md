# Canvas – Visually Center Existing Notes on Open

## Objective
Existing notes that are **opened** (from Recents, popup overlays, search, etc.) should appear centered in the current viewport, just like newly created notes. The implementation uses the same `freshNoteSeeds` + workspace caching pipeline as new notes to ensure the renderer receives the centered position before the first paint (no "snap"), while still allowing users to "restore" their saved layouts on demand.

**Note:** This applies only to **opening closed notes**. Notes already open in the workspace remain at their current positions—no centering occurs when switching between workspace tabs.

## Implementation Status

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Feature Flag:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_CANVAS_CENTER_EXISTING_NOTES` (enabled by default)

---

## How It Works (Actual Implementation)

### 1. Pure Viewport Centering (No Decay Blending)

**File:** `components/annotation-app.tsx` (lines 1479-1489)

When an existing note is opened with centering enabled:

```typescript
// EXISTING NOTES: Always use viewport center (null = use viewport center)
// Don't use lastCanvasInteractionRef because we want screen center, not last click position
const centeredCandidate = computeVisuallyCenteredWorldPosition(
  {
    translateX: currentCamera.translateX,
    translateY: currentCamera.translateY,
    zoom: currentCamera.zoom,
  },
  reopenSequenceRef.current,
  null,  // Force viewport center, ignore last interaction
)
```

**Key Decision:** Use `null` for last interaction to force viewport center (not the last click position).

---

### 2. Store in freshNoteSeeds (Prevent Snap)

**File:** `components/annotation-app.tsx` (lines 1482-1487)

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Store in freshNoteSeeds so canvas gets position BEFORE first paint
// This prevents the panel from appearing elsewhere and then moving
setFreshNoteSeeds(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  [noteId]: centeredCandidate
}))
```

**Why this matters:** The canvas checks `freshNoteSeeds[id]` FIRST (before `resolveWorkspacePosition`), so the panel renders at the centered position on the first paint—no movement, no snap.

---

### 3. Skip Camera Restoration (Prevent Canvas Movement)

**Files:**
- `lib/hooks/use-canvas-hydration.ts` (lines 165, 208, 758-771)
- `components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx` (lines 820-830)

**The Problem:** Hydration was restoring the old camera position from the database, which moved the canvas and made the centered note appear off-screen.

**The Fix:** Added `skipCameraRestore` option to `HydrationOptions`:

```typescript
// use-canvas-hydration.ts
export interface HydrationOptions {
  // ... existing options
  skipCameraRestore?: boolean  // Skip restoring camera state (for centered existing notes)
}

// Skip camera restoration when flag is set
if (cameraResult && shouldApplyServerCamera && !skipCameraRestore) {
  applyCameraState(cameraResult.camera)
} else if (skipCameraRestore) {
  debugLog({
    component: 'CanvasHydration',
    action: 'skipped_camera_restore',
    metadata: { reason: 'centered_existing_note' }
  })
}
```

```typescript
// annotation-canvas-modern.tsx
// Skip camera restore for centered existing notes (main-only mode)
const skipCameraRestore = mainOnlyNoteSet.has(noteId)

const primaryHydrationStatus = useCanvasHydration({
  noteId,
  userId: cameraUserId ?? undefined,
  dataStore,
  branchesMap,
  layerManager: layerManagerApi.manager,
  enabled: Boolean(noteId),
  skipCameraRestore  // ← Pass the flag
})
```

**Result:** Camera stays at current position, note appears centered, no movement.

---

### 4. Fix Branch Panel Following Main Panel Bug

**File:** `components/annotation-canvas-modern.tsx` (line 3517)

**The Bug:** When dragging the main panel, branch panels were visually snapping under it because `resolveWorkspacePosition()` was being called for ALL panels, returning the main panel's workspace position for branch panels.

**The Fix:** Only use `workspacePosition` for the main panel:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BUG):
const workspacePosition = resolveWorkspacePosition?.(panelNoteId) ?? null  // ❌ Used for all panels

// AFTER (FIXED):
const workspacePosition = (panelId === 'main')
  ? (resolveWorkspacePosition?.(panelNoteId) ?? null)
  : null  // ✅ Only for main panel
const position = workspacePosition ?? branch.position ?? getDefaultMainPosition()
```

**Result:** Branch panels now use their own saved `branch.position`, not the main panel's workspace position. When you drag the main panel, branches stay in place.

---

## Complete Data Flow

### Opening an Existing Note (Centered Mode)

1. **User clicks note in Recents**
   - `handleNoteSelect()` called with centered existing notes enabled

2. **Compute viewport-centered position**
   ```typescript
   // annotation-app.tsx:1481-1489
   const centeredCandidate = computeVisuallyCenteredWorldPosition(
     currentCamera,
     reopenSequenceRef.current,
     null  // Force viewport center
   )
   ```

3. **Store in freshNoteSeeds**
   ```typescript
   // annotation-app.tsx:1484-1487
   setFreshNoteSeeds(prev => ({ ...prev, [noteId]: centeredCandidate }))
   ```

4. **Add to mainOnlyNoteIds**
   ```typescript
   // annotation-app.tsx:1505-1506
   if (shouldCenterExisting) {
     requestMainOnlyNote(noteId)
   }
   ```

5. **Pass to openWorkspaceNote**
   ```typescript
   // annotation-app.tsx:1514-1518
   openWorkspaceNote(noteId, {
     persist: true,
     mainPosition: resolvedPosition,  // Centered position
     persistPosition: !skipPersistPosition,
   })
   ```

6. **Store in workspace entry**
   ```typescript
   // canvas-workspace-context.tsx:1142-1151
   setOpenNotes(prev => prev.map(note =>
     note.noteId === noteId
       ? { ...note, mainPosition: position }  // Centered position
       : note
   ))
   ```

7. **Canvas hydrates with skipCameraRestore**
   ```typescript
   // annotation-canvas-modern.tsx:820-830
   const skipCameraRestore = mainOnlyNoteSet.has(noteId)
   useCanvasHydration({ ..., skipCameraRestore })
   ```
   - Hydration loads panels but does NOT restore old camera position
   - Camera stays where user currently is

8. **Canvas creates panel from freshNoteSeeds**
   ```typescript
   // annotation-canvas-modern.tsx:672-676
   const seedPosition = freshNoteSeeds[id] ?? null
   const targetPosition = seedPosition ?? resolveWorkspacePosition(id) ?? getDefaultMainPosition()
   ```
   - Uses `freshNoteSeeds[id]` FIRST (our centered position)
   - Panel renders at centered position on first paint

9. **Panel renders**
   ```typescript
   // annotation-canvas-modern.tsx:3517-3518
   const workspacePosition = (panelId === 'main') ? resolveWorkspacePosition(noteId) : null
   const position = workspacePosition ?? branch.position ?? getDefaultMainPosition()
   ```
   - Main panel uses workspace position (centered)
   - Branch panels use their own saved positions (not affected by main panel)

10. **Result:**
    - ✅ Note appears centered in viewport
    - ✅ Camera doesn't move
    - ✅ No snap or jump
    - ✅ Branch panels stay in place

## Debug Logging

### Check if centering is working:
```sql
SELECT
  metadata->>'noteId' as note,
  metadata->'centeredCandidate' as centered_pos,
  metadata->'lastInteraction' as last_interaction
FROM debug_logs
WHERE component = 'AnnotationApp'
  AND action = 'existing_note_centered_candidate'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:** `lastInteraction` should be `null`, `centeredCandidate` should be viewport center.

### Check if camera restore was skipped:
```sql
SELECT metadata
FROM debug_logs
WHERE component = 'CanvasHydration'
  AND action = 'skipped_camera_restore'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:** Logs with reason `centered_existing_note`.

### Check branch panel positions:
```sql
SELECT
  metadata->>'panelId' as panel,
  metadata->'branchPosition' as branch_pos,
  metadata->'workspacePosition' as workspace_pos,
  metadata->'finalPosition' as final_pos
FROM debug_logs
WHERE component = 'AnnotationCanvas'
  AND action = 'panel_position_resolution'
  AND metadata->>'panelId' LIKE 'branch-%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:**
- `workspacePosition` should be `null` for branch panels
- `finalPosition` should equal `branchPosition` (their saved position)

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Basic centering:**
   - Pan/zoom canvas to any position
   - Open existing note from Recents
   - ✅ Note appears centered in current viewport
   - ✅ Canvas does NOT move

2. **Multiple rapid opens:**
   - Open several existing notes quickly
   - ✅ Each appears centered with diagonal offset
   - ✅ No overlap, no alternating positions

3. **Branch panel independence:**
   - Open note with branch panels
   - Drag a branch panel somewhere
   - Drag the main panel
   - ✅ Branch panel stays where you put it (doesn't follow main)

4. **Restore position affordance:**
   - Open centered note
   - Click "Restore position" icon
   - ✅ Camera animates to persisted position

### Regression Testing

- [ ] New notes still appear centered
- [ ] Dragging panels persists correctly
- [ ] Camera persistence works for normal operations
- [ ] Feature flag toggle works (disabling reverts to old behavior)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Restore position UI:** Not yet implemented (panel header button). Currently the persisted position is available in the database but no UI to jump to it.

2. **Diagonal offset:** Reuses the same offset counter as new notes. If you rapidly create new notes AND open existing notes, they share the offset sequence.

3. **Main-only mode dependency:** The centering triggers `requestMainOnlyNote()`, which hides branch panels initially. They can be revealed via the UI, but this couples centering to main-only mode.

---

## Summary of Fixes

1. **Pure viewport centering:** Removed decay blending, use 100% centered position
2. **Force viewport center:** Pass `null` for last interaction (not last click position)
3. **freshNoteSeeds usage:** Store centered position before canvas renders
4. **Skip camera restoration:** Don't restore old camera position for centered notes
5. **Fix branch following:** Only use workspace position for main panel, not branches
6. **App reload fix (2025-10-27):** Visibility-based centering - only center if note is NOT visible in viewport

**Result:** Existing notes appear centered when opened, canvas stays still, branches maintain their positions independently, and app reload preserves exact camera position when notes are visible.

---

## Post-Implementation Fix: App Reload Centering (2025-10-27)

### Issue
After implementing visual centering for existing notes, a new issue was discovered: **app reload caused unwanted camera movement** even when notes were already visible in the viewport. The AUTO-CENTER block was running unconditionally on every snapshot restoration.

### Solution
Implemented visibility-based centering with three-part fix:
1. **Visibility helper function:** `isPanelVisibleInViewport()` checks if panel intersects with viewport
2. **Conditional camera restoration:** Restore camera from snapshot for reload/tab switch, skip for newly opened notes
3. **Visibility-aware AUTO-CENTER:** Only center if note is newly opened OR not visible in viewport

### Result (Verified 2025-10-27)
- ✅ App reload preserves exact camera position (no unwanted movement)
- ✅ Notes still center correctly when opened from Recents/search
- ✅ Off-screen notes get centered on reload (helpful behavior)
- ✅ Debug logs confirm visibility checks working correctly

**Implementation Details:** See `2025-10-27-visibility-based-centering-plan.md`
