# Dashboard

The dashboard is the main view of an entry. It displays your widgets in a customizable layout where you can see information at a glance and quickly access different features.

## Dashboard Components

- **Widgets**: Interactive panels showing different types of content
- **Drawer**: Side panel that opens when you select a widget for details
- **Toolbar**: Access to navigation, settings, and chat

## How It Works

When you're on the dashboard, you can:
- Click widgets to open them in the drawer
- Use chat commands like "open recent" or "show quick links"
- Navigate to workspaces to edit notes
