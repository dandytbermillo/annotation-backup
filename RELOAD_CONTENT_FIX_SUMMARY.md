# Reload Content Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
After reload, both notes were showing the same content - specifically just the last word/character of Note 1. This happened because:
- Small Y.js updates (< 30 bytes) were being filtered out
- TipTap saved to 'default' fragment but persistence checked 'prosemirror' fragment
- Only large updates (multiple characters typed quickly) were saved

## The Solution
1. **Removed Update Filtering**: All Y.js updates now persist, regardless of size
2. **Dynamic Fragment Detection**: System detects which fragment contains content
3. **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing data without migration

## Key Code Changes
```typescript
// Before: Filtered out small updates
if (update.length < 30) {
  // Would skip single-character edits
  return;
}

// After: All updates persist
// No size filtering - every keystroke is saved
```

## Result
✅ Full content preserved after reload  
✅ Single-character edits are saved  
✅ Each note maintains unique content  
✅ No data migration needed  

## Testing
Run: `./test-reload-content-fix.sh` to verify the fix
