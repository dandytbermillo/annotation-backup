# Post-Reload Persistence Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
After reloading the page, new edits were not being saved to PostgreSQL. The initial content was preserved, but any changes made after reload were lost on the next reload.

## The Problem
- Y.Docs retrieved from cache didn't have persistence handlers
- Or had handlers with stale closure variables (`initialLoadComplete` stuck)
- No persistence setup for docs from enhanced provider

## The Solution
1. **Track Persistence Setup**: Added `docsWithPersistence` Set to track which docs have handlers
2. **Centralized Setup**: Created `setupPersistenceHandler()` function with fresh closures
3. **Check All Paths**: Every Y.Doc retrieval path now ensures persistence is set up

## Key Code Changes
```typescript
// Track which docs have persistence
const docsWithPersistence = new Set<string>()

// Ensure persistence on cache retrieval
if (editorDocs.has(cacheKey)) {
  const cachedDoc = editorDocs.get(cacheKey)!
  if (!docsWithPersistence.has(cacheKey)) {
    setupPersistenceHandler(cachedDoc, docKey, cacheKey, enhancedProvider)
  }
  return cachedDoc
}
```

## Result
✅ Initial content preserved on reload  
✅ New edits after reload are saved  
✅ All subsequent edits persist correctly  
✅ Works across all Y.Doc retrieval paths  

## Testing
Run: `./test-post-reload-persistence.sh` to verify the fix

## Technical Details
- Modified: `lib/yjs-provider.ts` (added persistence tracking and setup)
