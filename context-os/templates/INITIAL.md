#   date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
#   error: "Brief error description"
#   cause: "Root cause"
#   fix: "How it was/will be fixed"
#   command: "Command that failed"
#   resolved: false
```

---

## ESCALATION POLICY
- If `iteration_count >= 5` and unresolved errors ‚Üí Tag technical lead
- If security vulnerability found ‚Üí STOP and escalate immediately
- If data loss risk identified ‚Üí STOP and escalate immediately
- If breaking changes to existing features ‚Üí Require approval

---
