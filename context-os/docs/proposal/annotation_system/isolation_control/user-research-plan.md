# User Research Plan - Isolation Control System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the user research needed to validate and refine the isolation control system's user experience. The research will focus on understanding user reactions to automatic isolation, determining optimal thresholds, and identifying potential workflow disruptions.

---

## Research Objectives

### Primary Questions

1. **User Perception**
   - How do users react when a component is automatically isolated?
   - Do users understand why isolation occurred?
   - Do users trust the system's decisions?

2. **Workflow Impact**
   - Does isolation interrupt user workflows?
   - How quickly do users adapt to the isolation system?
   - What are the most common user actions after isolation?

3. **Threshold Optimization**
   - What performance degradation level do users notice?
   - When do users prefer manual vs automatic isolation?
   - What's the acceptable false positive rate?

4. **Communication Effectiveness**
   - Are the isolation notifications clear?
   - Do users understand the performance metrics shown?
   - What additional information do users need?

### Secondary Questions

- How do power users vs casual users interact with isolation controls?
- Should isolation settings be global or per-component?
- What's the optimal restoration mechanism (auto vs manual)?
- How should isolated components appear visually?

## Research Methods

### 1. Usability Testing

**Method**: Task-based testing with prototype

**Participants**: 12-15 users
- 5 heavy users (use canvas 4+ hours/day)
- 5 moderate users (1-3 hours/day)
- 5 new users (< 1 hour/day)

**Tasks**:
1. Work with canvas normally until isolation triggers
2. Respond to automatic isolation event
3. Manually isolate a problematic component
4. Restore isolated components
5. Adjust isolation sensitivity settings

**Metrics**:
- Time to understand isolation occurred
- Success rate of restoration
- Error recovery time
- User satisfaction (1-10 scale)
- Task completion rate

### 2. A/B Testing

**Variant A**: Aggressive isolation (low thresholds)
- Isolate at 40ms render time
- 2 consecutive bad frames trigger
- Auto-restore after 5 seconds

**Variant B**: Conservative isolation (high thresholds)
- Isolate at 70ms render time
- 5 consecutive bad frames trigger
- Manual restore only

**Metrics to Compare**:
- User engagement time
- Feature adoption rate
- Support ticket volume
- Performance improvement
- User retention

### 3. Contextual Inquiry

**Method**: Observe users in their natural environment

**Participants**: 8-10 users in their workspace

**Focus Areas**:
- When do performance issues typically occur?
- How do users currently handle slow components?
- What's their tolerance for performance degradation?
- How do they prioritize components?

**Data Collection**:
- Screen recordings
- Think-aloud protocol
- Post-session interviews
- Performance logs

### 4. Survey Research

**Target**: 100+ current canvas users

**Survey Sections**:

#### Performance Awareness
- How often do you notice performance issues?
- What actions cause the most lag?
- How do you currently handle slow performance?

#### Isolation Preferences
- Would you prefer automatic or manual isolation?
- What information helps you trust automation?
- How should isolated components appear?

#### Threshold Sensitivity
- Rate acceptable performance (Likert scale)
- Rank isolation triggers by importance
- Set personal threshold preferences

#### Communication Preferences
- Notification style (toast, inline, modal)
- Information density (minimal to detailed)
- Visual indicators (colors, icons, animations)

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Isolation Experience
```
Setup: User working normally
Trigger: Heavy calculation in calculator
Expected: User notices isolation, understands cause, restores when ready
Measure: Time to comprehension, emotional response, recovery action
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Isolations
```
Setup: Several heavy components
Trigger: System reaches isolation cap (3)
Expected: User prioritizes components, adjusts behavior
Measure: Decision-making process, frustration level
```

### Scenario 3: False Positive
```
Setup: Normal operation
Trigger: Temporary spike causes isolation
Expected: User quickly restores, possibly adjusts settings
Measure: Trust impact, setting adjustment rate
```

### Scenario 4: Workflow Interruption
```
Setup: User in focused work
Trigger: Component isolation during critical task
Expected: User either ignores or quickly resolves
Measure: Workflow disruption, task completion impact
```

### During-Test Questions
1. What just happened? (after isolation)
2. Why do you think that occurred?
3. What would you do next?
4. Is this helpful or disruptive?
5. What information is missing?

### Post-Test Questions
1. How did the isolation system affect your workflow?
2. Would you keep this feature enabled?
3. What would you change about the experience?
4. Did you trust the system's decisions?
5. Rate the feature 1-10 and explain why
