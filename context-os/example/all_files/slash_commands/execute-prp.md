# Execute BASE PRP

Implement a feature using using the PRP file.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all context and requirements
   - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the PRP fully
   - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed
   **Also:**
    - Load and comply with `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root as the authoritative policy file.  
    - If PRP instructions ever conflict with `CLAUDE.md`, defer to `CLAUDE.md` and document the deviation in the PR or error log.

1. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow.

2. **Execute the plan**
   - Execute the PRP
   - Implement all the code

3. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command
   - Fix any failures
   - Re-run until all pass

4. **Complete**
   - Ensure all checklist items done
   - Run final validation suite
   - Report completion status
   - Read the PRP again to ensure you have implemented everything

5. **Reference the PRP**
   - You can always reference the PRP again if needed

Note: If validation fails, use error patterns in PRP to fix and retry.
