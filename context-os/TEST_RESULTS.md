**Status**: âœ… SUCCESS

## Test Summary

Successfully tested Context-OS orchestration system with the "Center Note Window on Click" feature.

## What Was Tested

1. **Feature Creation Workflow**
   - âœ… Draft location: `context-os/drafts/center-note-window.md`
   - âœ… Multiple slug suggestions presented (3 options + custom)
   - âœ… User selected: `center_note_window_on_click`
   - âœ… Plan validation passed
   - âœ… Structure scaffolded successfully

2. **Created Structure**
   ```

       â””â”€â”€ README.md                  âœ…
   ```

3. **Compliance**
   - âœ… Follows Documentation Process Guide v1.4.5
   - âœ… All 8 rules enforced
   - âœ… Standard directory structure created (Rule 1)
   - âœ… Phase boundary markers included (Rule 2)
   - âœ… Fix organization by severity (Rule 3)
   - âœ… Post-implementation-fixes/README.md created (Rule 1)

## Key Enhancements Implemented

1. **Multiple Slug Suggestions** 
   - Provides 3 intelligent options based on description
   - Option for custom slug entry

2. **Patch Review Workflow**
   - Color-coded diff display
   - Edit option before applying
   - Automatic archiving

3. **COMPLETE Status Enforcement**
   - Blocks modifications to completed features
   - Checksum verification
   - Reopen request workflow

4. **ClassifierAgent**
   - Automatic severity classification (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Issue type detection (Bug/Performance/Security/UX/Enhancement)
   - SLA assignment
   - Workflow recommendations

5. **Fix-Specific Workflows**
   - Tailored processes for different issue types
   - Automatic routing to correct severity directory
   - Pre-filled fix documents with status tracking

## Important Change

**Drafts Location**: Moved from `drafts/` to `context-os/drafts/` to maintain compliance with Documentation Process Guide. This ensures:
- Pre-orchestration drafts stay within Context-OS scope
- Clear separation between unprocessed drafts and orchestrated features
- No violation of documentation structure rules

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Created draft
cp context-os/templates/INITIAL.md context-os/drafts/center-note-window.md

# Ran orchestration
node context-os/test-create.js

# Verified structure
ls -la docs/proposal/center_note_window_on_click/
```

## Next Steps

1. Feature is ready for implementation
2. Update status to `ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS` in implementation.md when starting
3. Use `fix-workflow.js` for any post-implementation issues
4. Run `status-enforcer.js` to manage feature lifecycle

## Conclusion

Context-OS successfully orchestrates compliant feature documentation following all Documentation Process Guide rules. The system provides:
- Interactive guidance for incomplete plans
- Automatic structure creation
- Built-in compliance validation
- Post-implementation fix management
- Status enforcement throughout lifecycle
