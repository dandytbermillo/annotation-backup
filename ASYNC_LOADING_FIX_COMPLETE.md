# Complete Fix for Empty Editor When Switching Notes

## Problem Summary
When switching between notes, the TipTap editor showed empty content because:
1. Y.Doc content loads asynchronously from PostgreSQL
2. TipTap renders immediately with an empty Y.Doc
3. Content appears only after reload because then the Y.Doc is cached

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Loading State Tracking (`lib/yjs-utils.ts`)
```typescript
export const docLoadingStates = new Map<string, Promise<void>>()
```
Tracks which Y.Docs are currently loading from PostgreSQL.

### 2. Updated Y.Doc Provider (`lib/yjs-provider.ts`)
- Track loading promises when creating new Y.Docs
- Clear loading state for cached docs
- Store promise so components can wait for completion

### 3. Added Loading UI (`components/canvas/canvas-panel.tsx`)
- Added `isContentLoading` state
- Wait for Y.Doc to load before rendering TipTap
- Show "Loading content..." message while waiting
- Reset loading state when switching notes

## Result
✅ No more empty editors when switching notes  
✅ Clear loading feedback for users  
✅ Content loads reliably from PostgreSQL  
✅ Maintains all existing functionality  

## Testing
1. Open the app at http://localhost:3000
2. Create multiple notes with different content
3. Switch between notes rapidly
4. You'll see "Loading content..." briefly
5. Content appears correctly without empty states

## Technical Details
- Loading is tracked per `noteId-panelId` combination
- Cached docs return immediately (no loading state)
- New docs show loading until PostgreSQL responds
- Compatible with all existing YJS and persistence features

This fix ensures a smooth user experience when navigating between notes while maintaining the PostgreSQL-based persistence architecture.
