# Infinite Load Loop Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
The terminal was flooding with continuous GET requests to `/api/persistence/load/` preventing proper persistence. Every idle moment generated dozens of requests per second.

## The Problem
- `getEditorYDoc` was called on every component render
- Each call triggered `setupPersistenceHandler`
- Each handler setup initiated a new load request
- No memoization or guards = infinite loop

## The Solution

### 1. Memoize Y.Doc Retrieval
```typescript
// Before: Called on every render
const ydoc = getEditorYDoc(panelId, currentNoteId)

// After: Only when deps change
const ydoc = useMemo(() => getEditorYDoc(panelId, currentNoteId), [panelId, currentNoteId])
```

### 2. Prevent Concurrent Loads
```typescript
if (docsCurrentlyLoading.has(cacheKey)) {
  return // Skip duplicate load
}
```

### 3. Guard Handler Setup
```typescript
if (!docsCurrentlyLoading.has(cacheKey) && !docsWithPersistenceHandlers.has(doc)) {
  setupPersistenceHandler(doc, docKey, cacheKey)
}
```

## Result
✅ Terminal is quiet when idle  
✅ Only ONE load request per document  
✅ Persistence works properly  
✅ No performance issues  

## Testing
Run: `./test-infinite-loop-fix.sh`

Watch your terminal - it should NOT show repeating requests anymore!

## Technical Details
- Modified: `components/canvas/canvas-panel.tsx` (added useMemo)
- Modified: `lib/yjs-provider.ts` (added load guards)
- Documentation: `fixes_doc/2024-08-27-infinite-load-loop-fix.md`

This is fix #10 in the TipTap persistence series!
